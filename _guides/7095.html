<p><strong>Supplier deposits and advances</strong> are funds paid by a business to a supplier before they have been earned. While the funds may be in the supplier’s hands, they are actually being held in trust for the business that pays the deposit and represent a liability the supplier must eventually either repay or convert to income by completion of the economic activity for which they are intended. Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deposits accompanying purchase orders for custom manufacturing</li>
<li>Prepayments for services or utilities to be invoiced later by the supplier</li>
<li>Deposits to hotels for confirmation of reservations</li>
<li>Deposits to landlords by tenants of rental property for cleaning or potential damages</li>
</ul>
<h3>Accounting for deposits and advances</h3>
<p>Two  essential facts must be recorded for every deposit:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Supplier</strong> - who is receiving the deposit?</li>
<li>
<strong>Amount</strong> - how much is the deposit?</li>
</ul>
<p>In Manager, both facts are recorded simultaneously when the deposit or advance is paid out. To record payment of a deposit, go to the <kbd>Bank Accounts</kbd> or <kbd>Cash Accounts</kbd> tab. Select <em>Spend Money</em> from the <kbd>New Bank Transaction</kbd> or <kbd>New Cash Transaction</kbd> dropdown list:</p>

<p>The first stage of a payment form will appear. Edit the <strong><code>Date</code></strong>, if necessary. Select the bank or cash account the deposit will be <strong><code>Paid from</code></strong>:</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.manager.io/uploads/manager1/original/2X/e/edd4912a82437e11661b89a44987521f1c020c06.png" alt="26 PM" width="335" height="210"></p>
<p>Complete the payment form. Leave the <strong><code>Item</code></strong> field blank. Select <em>Accounts payable</em> and the supplier’s subaccount. <strong>Leave the <code>Invoice</code> field blank.</strong> A quantity is not required, because no inventory items or billable items are involved with a deposit. You may simply enter the total deposit in the <strong><code>Unit price</code></strong> field. However, if you wish, enter the quantity and unit price and Manager will calculate a total amount:</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.manager.io/uploads/manager1/original/2X/9/962f5dc986515515592c2efaf142c7d1d75af3ba.png" alt="07 PM" width="690" height="249"></p>
<p>Click <kbd>Create</kbd> to finish.</p>
<table style="background-color: #F2F9FF; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px"><tr><td style="font-size: 48px; opacity: 0.25; padding: 20px; padding-top: 15px; padding-right: 0px; vertical-align: top"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></td><td style="padding: 20px">
<p><strong>Notes</strong><br>
Deposits, even those involving calculations with quantities and unit prices, have no impact on inventory values or quantities because no inventory item is designated.</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>When payments are entered under <kbd>Bank Transactions</kbd>, no <code>Reference</code> number is generated, because the financial institution usually assigns a reference number. But when entered under <kbd>Cash Accounts</kbd>, a <code>Reference</code> is automatically assigned. Manager finds the highest previous integer value and adds 1.</p>
<h3>Using deposits and advances</h3>
<p>The payment will now be deducted from the applicable bank or cash account’s balance. If marked as pending, it will show in the <code>Pending withdrawals</code> column under the <kbd>Bank Accounts</kbd> or <kbd>Cash Accounts</kbd> tab:</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.manager.io/uploads/manager1/original/2X/5/50b9e9c231a0529c7fa23711b019d24b0d14e6e0.png" alt="07 PM" width="679" height="69"></p>
<p>The deposit also reduces the total <em>Accounts payable</em> balance, though the impact of a specific deposit may be obscured on the Balance Sheet if other amounts are owed to any supplier:</p>

<p>To view specific information about supplier deposits, you must first drill down by clicking the <em>Accounts payable</em> balance and locating the supplier’s account <code>Balance</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.manager.io/uploads/manager1/original/2X/d/d2315434e7253bd11a09dd3950cbb0014bf29164.png" alt="34 PM" width="690" height="274"></p>
<p>Clicking on the balance, you can see transactions contributing to it, including the recent deposit payment:</p>

<p>You can do the same thing in the <kbd>Suppliers</kbd> tab, with identical results.</p>
<p>Whenever a purchase invoice is created for a supplier, any available net debit in that supplier’s <em>Accounts payable</em> balance will be automatically applied, reducing the balance due on the new purchase invoice.</p>
<table style="background-color: #F2F9FF; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px"><tr><td style="font-size: 48px; opacity: 0.25; padding: 20px; padding-top: 15px; padding-right: 0px; vertical-align: top"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></td><td style="padding: 20px">
<p><strong>Note</strong><br>
Deposits and advances cannot be applied on purchases recorded only via cash payments. Such transactions are not processed through <em>Accounts payable</em>, so Manager cannot apply any available balance. If you purchase from a supplier on a cash-and-carry basis, but wish to apply an existing deposit or advance, you must create and pay off a purchase invoice in separate transactions.</p>
