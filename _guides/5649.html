<p>When you use <a href="https://forum.manager.io/t/tax-codes/8901">tax codes</a>, Manager automatically calculates the tax amount based on the tax rate. But when an expense involves partial personal use, you may need to <strong>adjust tax accounting</strong>, because a portion of the expense is not a legitimate business expense. Therefore, a portion of the tax Manager would normally calculate is not attributable to the business and cannot be used to offset amounts owed to your tax authority, as reported in the <em>Tax payable</em> account.</p>

<p>To properly adjust tax accounting, split a line item partially for personal use into two lines on the payment form. Apportion the <code>Unit price</code> by the percentage of business versus personal use. Apply the tax code only to the line for the business portion. Post the remainder to <em>Owner's equity</em> or <em>Capital accounts</em> (as a draw), depending on your form of organization. Include the applicable portion of tax paid on the personal-use line, but do not apply a tax code, since tax paid for personal use is not a business expense.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Example</strong><br>John Smith, a partner in a business, spends $110 on fuel and oil for a business vehicle. The payment includes 10% tax. John would normally record the transaction like this:<br><br><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/9e1d7642d53e3ea03cf083bcf4641ed548ff0242" href="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/9/9e1d7642d53e3ea03cf083bcf4641ed548ff0242.png" class="lightbox" title="Screen Shot 2017-04-24 at 3.37.12 PM.png"><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/optimized/2X/9/9e1d7642d53e3ea03cf083bcf4641ed548ff0242_1_690x56.png" width="690" height="56"><div class="meta">

</div></a></div><br><br>$100 would be added to the <em>Motor vehicle expenses</em> account and $10 would be subtracted from the <em>Tax payable</em> liability account.<br><br>But 50% of this expense is for John's personal use of the company's car, so he can't claim the full $110 as having been paid by the business on <em>Motor vehicle expenses</em>. He can only claim half. John splits the transaction using the <kbd>Add line</kbd> button like this:<br><br><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/b9c6cc176507cebb8e913e4b9c0eb9c1103e410d" href="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/b/b9c6cc176507cebb8e913e4b9c0eb9c1103e410d.png" class="lightbox" title="Screen Shot 2017-04-24 at 3.45.09 PM.png"><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/optimized/2X/b/b9c6cc176507cebb8e913e4b9c0eb9c1103e410d_1_690x102.png" width="690" height="102"><div class="meta">

</div></a></div><br><br>In the Tax Summary, this transaction is reported like this:<br><br><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/0/0906127b13e04201d4a80a3d195ecb971607896e.png" width="624" height="265"><br><br>And John's <em>Capital accounts</em> balance is reduced by $55, just as though he had received a payment from the company from his share of profits.</p></blockquote>
