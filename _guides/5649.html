title: Adjust tax accounting for partial personal use

{% raw %}
<p>When you use <a href="/guides/8901">tax codes</a>, Manager automatically calculates the tax amount based on the tax rate. But when an expense involves partial personal use, you may need to <strong>adjust tax accounting</strong>, because a portion of the expense is not a legitimate business expense. Therefore, a portion of the tax Manager would normally calculate is not attributable to the business and cannot be used to offset amounts owed to your tax authority, as reported in the <em>Tax payable</em> account.</p>

<p>To properly adjust tax accounting, split a line item partially for personal use into two lines on the payment form. Apportion the <code>Unit price</code> by the percentage of business versus personal use. Apply the tax code only to the line for the business portion. Post the remainder to <em>Owner's equity</em> or <em>Capital accounts</em> (as a draw), depending on your form of organization. Include the applicable portion of tax paid on the personal-use line, but do not apply a tax code, since tax paid for personal use is not a business expense.</p>

The payment includes 10% tax. John would normally record the transaction like this:<br><br><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/9/9e1d7642d53e3ea03cf083bcf4641ed548ff0242.png"><br><br>$100 would be added to the <em>Motor vehicle expenses</em> account and $10 would be subtracted from the <em>Tax payable</em> liability account.<br><br>But 50% of this expense is for John's personal use of the company's car, so he can't claim the full $110 as having been paid by the business on <em>Motor vehicle expenses</em>. He can only claim half. John splits the transaction using the <kbd>Add line</kbd> button like this:<br><br><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/b/b9c6cc176507cebb8e913e4b9c0eb9c1103e410d.png"><br><br>In the Tax Summary, this transaction is reported like this:<br><br><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/0/0906127b13e04201d4a80a3d195ecb971607896e.png" width="624" height="265"><br><br>And John's <em>Capital accounts</em> balance is reduced by $55, just as though he had received a payment from the company from his share of profits.</p></td></tr></table>
