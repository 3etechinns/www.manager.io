<p>This feature is often useful for posting transactions from <a href="/guides/9240">imported bank statements</a> to proper accounts when they are not handled automatically by <a href="/guides/9243">bank rules</a>. It can also be used in other situations, including when new accounts are added.</p>

<p><strong>Examples</strong><br>
Northwind Traders routinely contributes money to charities in return for acknowledgement in the charities’ publications. The business believes local regulations allow a deduction from income for the donations. However, at the end of the fiscal year, the company’s accountant determines that such contributions are not eligible for treatment as charitable donations, but only as advertising expenses. So every donation recorded during the year must be recoded from a <em>Donations</em> account to an <em>Advertising and promotion</em> expense account. This can be done very quickly using <kbd>Find &amp; recode</kbd>.<br>
<br>Mariana begins using Manager for her catering business, posting all sales to a generic <em>Sales</em> income account. After several months, she realizes she could make better marketing decisions if her sales were broken down into several categories. She renames her existing <em>Sales</em> account as <em>Business catering</em> and adds <em>Weddings</em> and <em>Private events</em> to her chart of accounts. Mariana then uses <kbd>Find &amp; recode</kbd> to transfer wedding and private event sales to their new accounts, leaving her remaining business sales in the original, renamed account.</p>
