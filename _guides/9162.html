<h3>Create an administrator user</h3>

<p><strong>Administrators</strong> have full access to everything. They can create new users, set permissions for existing users, enable new tabs, and adjust settings. To set up a new administrator, go to the <kbd>Users</kbd> tab:</p>

          </a>


<p>Click <kbd>Create</kbd>.</p>

<h3>Create a restricted user</h3>

<p><strong>Restricted users</strong> have limited authority within a single business or multiple businesses. You can control not only what they can see, but also what they can do, in great detail. Typically, you should create most new users as restricted users. When creating a restricted user, select <em>Restricted user</em> in the <code>Role</code> field. Then select businesses they should have access to.</p>

          </a>


<p>When restricted users are created, you will see them under the <kbd>Users</kbd> tab with the names of businesses they are allowed to see:</p>

          </a>


<p>By default, restricted users will have full access to each business listed under their name. If you would like to restrict their access within a business, click on the business name under their name and in the <code>User Permissions</code> field, change <em>Full access</em> to <em>Restricted access</em>.</p>

          </a>


<p>This will reveal new options to further control what the user can do and see.</p>

<p>A <code>Permitted Actions</code> dropdown box will appear, offering a range of choices. Below the <code>Permitted Actions</code> field, tabs enabled for the business will be listed. Check boxes to assign permissions:</p>

<p>If the <kbd>Reports</kbd> tab is checked, a list of reports for active tabs will show. Check reports you want the user to see:</p>

<p>If <kbd>Settings</kbd> is checked, a list of settings applicable to enabled tabs will appear. Choose those the user should be able to modify:</p>

<p>When a user logs in, she or he will only see tabs for which permission has been granted:</p>
