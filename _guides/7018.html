<p>A <strong>Customer</strong> in Manager is an entity (person, business, or other organization) with whom you have or plan to have an <em>Accounts receivable</em> relationship. Customers in Manager are actually subaccounts of <em>Accounts receivable</em>. You must first create a Customer before you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Issue a sales invoice</li>
<li>Sell on credit for future payment</li>
<li>Create a customer statement showing balances due or summarizing past transactions</li>
<li>Issue a credit note for return of goods</li>
<li>Generate a sales quote for future business</li>
<li>Receive a deposit or advance against future work or delivery of goods</li>
<li>Record billable time or expenses for later invoicing</li>
<li>Track your complete sales and receipts history with the entity</li>
</ul>

<p>Not everyone to whom you sell must necessarily be defined as a Customer. You can make a cash sale involving immediate payment without creating a Customer simply by entering a name as <code>Payer</code> when <a href="https://forum.manager.io/t/receive-money/7820">receiving money into a cash account</a>. But such transactions will not be recorded in a history for that Payer, even if the Payer is already defined as a Customer.</p>

<p>To enable the <kbd>Customers</kbd> tab, click <kbd>Customize</kbd> below the left navigation pane, check the box for <kbd>Customers</kbd>, and click <kbd>Update</kbd> below the list:</p>

<p>Your Customer will now appear in the <kbd>Customers</kbd> tab. Customers are listed in alphabetical order according to their names. Use scrolling, paging, and search functions to find them. The listing shows the number of sales invoices issued to a Customer, value of any uninvoiced items (billable time and expenses), and the Customer's <em>Accounts receivable</em> balance. Click on blue numbers for more details of any column.</p>
