<p>You can <strong>export lists and reports</strong> from Manager to use in word processing documents or spreadsheets. Rather than export in formats unique to any specific application, Manager makes data available in tab-separated-value (TSV) format. TSV-formatted data can be imported or pasted into virtually all word-processing and spreadsheet programs on the market.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong><br>Completed transaction forms, such as sales invoices, expense claims, journal entries, or purchase orders, cannot be exported. These forms are not data files, but presentations of data from files. Customer lists, cash account registers, or fixed asset ledgers, on the other hand, are data lists and can be exported.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Export from the screen display</h3>

<p>Any list or report that can be exported has an <kbd>Export (X)</kbd> button at the lower right corner. The <em>X</em> is a number showing how many rows of data will be exported following a row of column headings. The export function preserves any search or sort operations performed on the data prior to export.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Example</strong><br>Northwind Traders wants to create a spreadsheet of expense claim information to support a monthly management review. The main listing of the <kbd>Expense Claims</kbd> tab can be exported. It is sorted according to claim amount by clicking on the <code>Amount</code> column heading:<br><img src="/uploads/manager1/original/2X/8/821a97780733a3603562f94b56b1012c8e52ae40.png" width="690" height="192"></p></blockquote>

<h3>Copy the data</h3>

<p>Click on the <kbd>Export (X)</kbd> button to view the TSV data. Click within the grey data window to select all the data, or click and drag to select only a portion of it. Copy the selected data.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Example</strong><br><br><img src="/uploads/manager1/original/2X/a/a883e2085bfd3c76bf508bff3a41996bb5955455.png" width="655" height="174"></p></blockquote>

<h3>Paste data into destination document</h3>

<p>Open a word-processing or spreadsheet document and paste in the data. Depending on your purpose, TSV-formatted data is usually best pasted into a pre-formatted table in a word-processing document. It can usually be pasted into the first cell of a spreadsheet, where it will automatically be parsed into individual cells. (Exact behavior in the destination document depends on your operating system, application, and version. TSV formatting is used by Manager because it is the most flexible.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Example</strong><br><br><img src="/uploads/manager1/original/2X/1/104a29f5bb68c2f70813cdc2dcaafc23c4613f58.png" width="560" height="69"></p></blockquote>

<p>Functions available in the destination application can be applied to the exported data for analysis or presentation.</p>
