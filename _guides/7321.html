<p>A <strong>cash sale</strong> occurs when a customer pays for goods or services immediately upon delivery. No credit is extended by the seller. No account receivable is created. Resulting revenue is posted immediately to an income account, regardless of whether the business uses <a href="/guides/7129">accrual or cash basis accounting</a>. Therefore, <strong>no sales invoice is required</strong>. The entire transaction occurs in a single step.</p>
<table style="background-color: #F2F9FF; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px"><tr><td style="font-size: 48px; opacity: 0.25; padding: 20px; padding-top: 15px; padding-right: 0px; vertical-align: top"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></td><td style="padding: 20px">
<p><strong>Note</strong><br>
A cash sale does not need to involve receipt of physical cash. Money can be received via any form of exchange and deposited into either a cash or bank account. The distinguishing feature is that credit is not extended by the seller to the customer.</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Before a cash sale can be entered into Manager, at least one <a href="/guides/11367">bank account</a> or <a href="/guides/9219">cash account</a> must be created. Then, within the <kbd>Bank Accounts</kbd> or <kbd>Cash Accounts</kbd> tab, click <kbd>New Bank Transaction</kbd> or <kbd>New Cash Transaction</kbd> and select <em>Receive money</em>:</p>

<p>Complete the cash receipt. By default, today’s date and <a href="/guides/7307">cleared transaction status</a> are selected. These entries may be edited. The <code>Payer</code> field can be used to enter the customer’s name, the receipt could be made out to <em>Cash</em>, or the field can be left blank, according to local custom or business policy. Line items can be entered either semi-automatically, by selecting inventory or non-inventory items, or manually. Applicable <a href="/guides/8901">tax codes</a> can be selected.</p>

<p>Click <kbd>Create</kbd> to complete the transaction. Any necessary adjustments will be posted to inventory accounts.</p>

<p><strong>CAUTION</strong><br>
Unit prices on cash sales are assumed to be inclusive of taxes calculated in accordance with the selected tax code. The calculated tax will not be added to the <code>Amount</code>, but will increase the <em>Tax payable</em> account.</p>

<p>To view the receipt, go to either the <kbd>Bank Accounts</kbd> or <kbd>Cash Accounts</kbd> tab, depending on which type of account was used to receive the money. Locate the transaction and click <kbd>View</kbd>:</p>

<p>The receipt can be given to the customer as evidence of the sale:</p>

<table style="background-color: #F2F9FF; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px"><tr><td style="font-size: 48px; opacity: 0.25; padding: 20px; padding-top: 15px; padding-right: 0px; vertical-align: top"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></td><td style="padding: 20px">
<p><strong>Notes</strong><br>
When a cash sale is entered, any available credits the customer may have from credit notes or returns will not be applied. This is because such credits are recorded in customers’ subaccounts in <em>Accounts receivable</em>, which is not invoked for cash sales. To use such credits, a <a href="/guides/7178">sales invoice</a> must be used instead.<br>
<br>When a <a href="/guides/7022">customer statement</a> is created, cash sales for that customer will not be included. If a complete record of sales to a specific customer is desired, sales invoices must be used.<br>
<br>When many cash sales are made, such as to walk-in customers in a retail shop, a single cash receipt summarizing the day’s sales can be entered into Manager. A cash register or point-of-sale system can be used to record individual sales, issue customer receipts, and manage cash.</p>
