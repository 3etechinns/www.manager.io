<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong><br>Removing a business name does not delete the business, which is not stored in the application. It only removes its name from the <kbd>Businesses</kbd> list. The business' complete data file will remain untouched in the <a href="https://forum.manager.io/t/application-data-folder/8394">application data folder</a>. To completely eliminate the business, it must be deleted from the application data folder.</p></blockquote>
