**Themes can be customized** in Manager to include, exclude, or modify features or change placement of information. First, however, a custom theme must be added under <kbd>Settings</kbd>. Usually, the easiest approach is to install a theme copied from the https://www.manager.io/themes website as a baseline and edit it. Themes can, however, be coded from scratch. Either way, new themes are added according to instructions in [another Guide](https://forum.manager.io/t/change-the-look-of-forms-with-themes/10366).

###Editing a theme

To edit a theme, go to <kbd>Settings</kbd> => <kbd>Themes</kbd> and click <kbd>Edit</kbd> next to the theme you want to customize:

The Liquid computer code for the theme will appear:

Edit the code directly in the window. Click <kbd>Update</kbd> below the editing window to save changes. If you are not familiar with the Liquid language, numerous educational websites can be found on the internet.

###Viewing a theme

To see the results of your editing, return to the <kbd>Themes</kbd> list and click <kbd>View</kbd>:

A generic image of your theme will be displayed, with representative content:
