<p>You are applying for a loan and your bank has requested profit and loss statement (P&amp;L). Or your accountant wants to lodge your tax returns and is in need of your P&amp;L. What is it?</p>

<p>A profit and loss statement (P&amp;L) is a financial statement that summarizes the income and expenses incurred during a specific period of time, usually a fiscal quarter or year.</p>

<p>In Manager, there are two ways to get P&amp;L out. The "dirty" way assumes you already know the final figures and "clean" way means you don't know the figures so you will enter all transactions within a period individually and let Manager sum them up for you.</p>

<h3>Create a business</h3>

<p>Click <kbd>Add Business</kbd> button then <kbd>Create New Business</kbd>, enter your business name and click <kbd>Add Business</kbd> button.</p>

<p>Your business should be successfully created.</p>

<p><img src="https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business2/uploads/manager1/original/2X/3/3b8f703ea6050f3e1b8718955e02f0dfd58403c4.png"></p>

<p>Normally at this point we would click on <em>Customize</em> to add new tabs but if all you want is to generate a P&amp;L statement and you know the figures (dirty way), we don't have to enable any additional features as we have all we need.</p>

<h3>Recording a journal entry</h3>

<p>Let's say we need to generate P&amp;L for December 31, 2016. If you know your figures, go to <kbd>Journal Entries</kbd> tab and click <kbd>New Journal Entry</kbd> button.</p>

<p><img src="https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business2/uploads/manager1/original/2X/f/f822f578160151e8446dc78aae4316725d93c1d7.png" width="318" height="73"></p>

<p>Then enter your figures for all applicable <em>Income</em> and <em>Expense</em> accounts. Income figures always go to <em>Credit</em> column and expense figures go to <em>Debit</em> column. Also, make sure to set the date to <code>31/12/2016</code>.</p>

<table style="background-color: #F2F9FF; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px"><tr><td style="font-size: 48px; opacity: 0.25; padding: 20px; padding-top: 15px; padding-right: 0px; vertical-align: top"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></td><td style="padding: 20px"><p>Normally all journal entries must balance to adhere to rules of double-entry accounting principles. Since we only want to generate P&amp;L statement, we can relax rules a bit for now.</p></td></tr></table>

<p>Once you are done, click <kbd>Create</kbd> button.</p>

<p><img src="https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business2/uploads/manager1/original/2X/f/f4ed646d44ba19b8063d3f5e9c25327eb82cb681.png" width="225" height="82"></p>

<h3>Generate Profit &amp; Loss statement</h3>

<p>Once your journal entry is saved, go to <kbd>Reports</kbd> tab.</p>

<p><img src="https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business2/uploads/manager1/original/2X/b/b4dc6159b7890be759a9cb88976e4e2f83f1af33.png" width="207" height="54"></p>

<p>Then click <kbd>Profit and Loss Statement</kbd></p>

<p><img src="https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business2/uploads/manager1/original/2X/8/8f8183aa2bfb32adecc2eb3a05245266e80f29f0.png" width="300" height="106"></p>

<p>And finally <kbd>New Report</kbd> button.</p>

<p><img src="https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business2/uploads/manager1/original/2X/6/68b0750960bbdd9c17ef2fa1fa5bd18d74149d1d.png" width="345" height="72"></p>

<p>Here you will need to enter period for which your P&amp;L is for. Let's say the income and expense figures you have entered in journal entry cover the whole year 2016. Your period should be set to be from <em>January 1, 2016</em> until <em>December 31, 2016</em>. Optionally you can also set column name to <em>FY 2016</em> which is abbreviation for <em>Financial Year 2016</em>.</p>

<p>After you click <kbd>Create</kbd>, you will be able to view your newly-created report.</p>

<p><img src="https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business2/uploads/manager1/original/2X/c/caec8559fdaa1c79f43fc2c17a668af1a0c05a6d.png"></p>

<p>So there you go. Quick &amp; dirty way to generate professional-looking P&amp;L for your bank or an accountant.</p>

<h3>Comparative P&amp;L</h3>

<p>Your P&amp;L will look even more trustworthy if you make it show multiple periods side-by-side. For example, we can show FY 2015 figures next to FY 2016 figures. In order to do that, record another journal entry which will capture income &amp; expense figures for FY 2015. The journal entry should be dated as at December 31, 2015.</p>

<p>Then edit this P&amp;L report to add comparative period by clicking on <kbd>Add comparative column</kbd> button. Then enter period details for FY 2015.</p>

<p><img src="https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business2/uploads/manager1/original/2X/2/2ab39da7b0b7e7df2263091a1bcc48f946b8bfe5.png" width="468" height="143"></p>

<p>Click <kbd>Update</kbd> button to view new P&amp;L.</p>

<p><img src="https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business2/uploads/manager1/original/2X/d/d53c12ae30ceb5acc7d98f90cd01d3ca3bea9259.png"></p>

<p>As you can see, now you have two periods side-by-side which looks much better. You can keep going to add as many periods as you like.</p>

<h3>Multi-step P&amp;L</h3>

<p>Manager also supports custom income &amp; expense groups, sub-groups (unlimited levels) and custom totals which can cater for entities with more complex layout requirements. If you want your P&amp;L to show <em>gross profit</em>, <em>operating profit</em>, <em>net profit before income tax</em> in addition to custom sub-groups, you can re-organize your <em>Chart of Accounts</em> to reflect your business requirements with ease. Your end result could look like this:</p>
