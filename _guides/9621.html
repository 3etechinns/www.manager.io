<p><kbd><strong>Batch Delete</strong></kbd> in the <kbd>Cash Accounts</kbd> tab allows you to quickly, but selectively, delete transactions as a group. It is intended primarily for correction of mistaken <a href="https://forum.manager.io/t/import-bank-statements/9240">imports of bank statements</a> without the need to edit and delete transactions one by one. Or it might be used if management discovers accounting personnel have made systematic errors that cannot be corrected using the <kbd><a href="https://forum.manager.io/t/find-recode-transactions/8679">Find &amp; recode</a></kbd> function.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong><br>A <kbd>Batch Delete</kbd> function is also available in several other tabs, but works differently there. That function is described <a href="https://forum.manager.io/t/batch-operations-except-cash-accounts/9572">in another Guide</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the <kbd>Cash Accounts</kbd> tab, click on any blue balance for the cash account where you want to make batch deletions. This can be:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Cleared balance</code></li>
<li><code>Pending deposits</code></li>
<li><code>Pending withdrawals</code></li>
<li><code>Actual balance</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Whichever balance is selected, a list of contributing transactions appears. In the illustration below, the <code>Pending deposits</code> balance for the main business account has been clicked. Note the <kbd>Batch Delete</kbd> button below the list:</p>
