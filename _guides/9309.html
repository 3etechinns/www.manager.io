<p><strong><em>Accounts payable</em></strong> is a liability account that records amounts the business owes to <a href="https://forum.manager.io/t/creating-and-using-suppliers/7020">suppliers</a>. In Manager, this is a control account, meaning it is built into the software and is made up of subaccounts for suppliers defined in the <kbd>Suppliers</kbd> tab. Normally, it should <strong>not</strong> be created manually in the chart of accounts.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>CAUTION</strong><br>If <em>Accounts payable</em> is created manually in the chart of accounts, many built-in functions will be lost. Manager will not be able to associate purchase invoices with specific suppliers. And it will not be able to apply advances, deposits, or overpayments paid to suppliers to purchase invoices.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Activate <em>Accounts payable</em>

<p>To activate <em>Accounts payable</em>, enable the <kbd>Suppliers</kbd> tab. Click <kbd>Customize</kbd> below the left navigation pane, check the box for <kbd>Suppliers</kbd>, and click <kbd>Update</kbd> below the list.</p>
