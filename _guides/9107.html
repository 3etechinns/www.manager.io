<p>When migrating to Manager from a prior accounting system, fixed assets must be carried forward at their book values from the previous system. This is easily accomplished in Manager as fixed assets are created. Two pieces of information are required for every fixed asset being carried forward:</p>

<ul>
<li>Initial purchase cost</li>
<li>Total of accumulated depreciation at the closing date of the prior accounting system</li>
</ul>

<h3>Migrate a fixed asset</h3>

<p>Basic procedures for creating fixed assets in Manager are described in <a href="/guides/9106">another Guide</a>. Read it first.</p>

<p>To migrate an existing fixed asset, go to the left navigation pane, click <kbd>Fixed Assets</kbd>, then <kbd>New Fixed Asset</kbd>:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong><code>Item code</code></strong> is an optional alphabetic or numeric designation for the fixed asset.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>Item name</code></strong> is the name that will appear for the fixed asset in reports and lists.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>Description</code></strong> accepts detailed information about the fixed asset.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>Starting balance</code></strong> should be checked. Before you can enter a starting balance, you must set the Start Date in the <kbd>Settings</kbd> tab.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>Purchase cost</code></strong> is the initial cost of the fixed asset when first acquired.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>Accumulated depreciation</code></strong> is the sum of all depreciation entered for this fixed asset under the prior accounting system.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>Book value</code></strong> will calculate automatically. It should match the book value on the final day of the prior accounting system.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>Disposed fixed asset</code></strong> should be left blank as you create the fixed asset.</li>
</ul>

<p>Click <kbd>Create</kbd>. The fixed asset will show under the <kbd>Fixed Assets</kbd> tab:</p>

<p>The purchase cost of the fixed asset will be combined with any other fixed assets' costs and displayed under the <em>Assets</em> category on the <kbd>Summary</kbd> page. A contra account, <em>Fixed assets, accumulated depreciation</em>, will record depreciation to date for all fixed assets. The difference between the two account balances represents current book value of all fixed assets:</p>
