<p><strong>Cash accounts</strong> are used to record current transactions involving exchanges of money in any form. Virtually every business needs at least one cash account. Possibilities include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bank accounts</li>
<li>Credit cards</li>
<li>Petty cash funds</li>
<li>Cash tills</li>
<li>PayPal accounts</li>
<li>Crypto-currency accounts (<em>e. g.</em>, BitCoin)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Enable the <kbd>Cash Accounts</kbd> tab</h3>

<p>Before you can create a cash account, you must enable the <kbd>Cash Accounts</kbd> tab. Click <img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/4/499ff13996c2fb20609f181305130b5602208537.png" width="64" height="17"> below the left navigation pane, check the box for <img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/a/ae29c5031fb958f11afef4b569d01d1aabbf6272.png" width="117" height="22">, and click <kbd>Update</kbd>. You will see the <kbd>Cash Accounts</kbd> tab added to the left navigation pane.</p>

<h3>Create a cash account</h3>

<p>Click the <kbd>Cash Accounts</kbd> tab, then <kbd>New Cash Account</kbd>:</p>

<p>Define the cash account:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong><code>Name</code></strong> the account so it will be recognizable. The name could include a description, a bank's name, a credit card designation, or an account number.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>Code</code></strong> allows you to set the order in which cash accounts are listed. Enter a number. If blank, accounts will display in alphabetical order.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>Credit limit</code></strong> can be set, especially for credit cards. You can also use this field to indicate the amount of overdraft protection. (This box appears only for cash accounts maintained by financial institutions.)</li>
<li>
<strong><code>Currency</code></strong> options will be available if you have set a base currency. By default, cash accounts are undenominated. That is, they are assumed to be in your native currency, whatever that is. But if you plan to use multiple currencies, or just want your currency symbol to appear on forms and reports, set a base currency. (Go to <kbd>Settings</kbd> <strong><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right" style="margin-right: 10px; color: #999; font-size: 18px; padding-top: 5px"></i></strong> <kbd>Base Currency</kbd>, select a base currency in the dropdown box and click <kbd>Update</kbd>.) Cash accounts will then automatically be denominated in your base currency. Change the selection for a specific cash account in its <code>Currency</code> dropdown box.</li>
<li>Check the box if the <strong><code>account is maintained by a bank or other financial institution</code></strong>. Checking the box will enable you to track pending deposits and withdrawals and reconcile the account with financial statements from the institution. If you do not check this box, Manager will treat the account as a cash fund.</li>
<li>The <strong><code>Starting balance</code></strong> check box will appear only if you have set a start date for your business. Enter the account balance on the start date in the blank field that appears when the box is checked. This feature is used when migrating to Manager from a prior accounting system.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should only add cash accounts that belong to the business. Personal credit cards and personal bank accounts used infrequently for business transactions should not be added as cash accounts.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong><br>Brilliant Industries has one business bank account used to receive money from customers and pay suppliers and employees. The business also holds cash on hand to pay for staff amenities and other petty cash expenses. The business owner occasionally uses a personal credit card for business expenses. Brilliant Industries creates two cash accounts.<br><br><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/3/3d1360c87c4cb89c05573dabde5f35b3afa14801.png" width="663" height="165"><br></p>
<p>Brilliant Industries does not create a cash account for the personal credit card of the owner because it is a personal account. The owner's use of the personal credit card will be recorded in the <kbd>Expense Claims</kbd> tab.</p>

<h3>View cash account balances</h3>

<p>By default, all cash accounts are combined into an automatic control account named <em>Cash &amp; cash equivalents</em> for Balance Sheet reporting:</p>

<p>You can see more detailed information by selecting the <kbd>Cash Accounts</kbd> tab. Here, you can find information about all cash accounts, even if you have modified your chart of accounts to have them reported on the Balance Sheet under different control accounts. You will also see pending transactions, if any.</p>
