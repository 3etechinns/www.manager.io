<p><strong>Capital accounts</strong> track contributions from, distributions of earnings to, and drawings of owners or others with financial interests in a business entity. They can be adapted to suit any type of entity, including sole proprietors, partnerships, companies, trusts, and funds.</p>

<h3>Setting up capital accounts</h3>

<p>Enable the <kbd>Capital Accounts</kbd> tab, following instructions in <a href="https://forum.manager.io/t/simplify-manager/7397">another Guide</a>. The tab will appear in the left navigation pane. The number in the window indicates the number of capital accounts established:</p>

<p>In the <kbd>Capital Accounts</kbd> tab, click <kbd>New Capital Account</kbd> to define the first member or owner of a capital account:</p>

<p>If making a transition to Manager from a previous accounting system, the member may already have a capital balance to transfer. In that case, check the box indicating a starting balance on the Start Date. For positive capital account balances, select <em>Paid in advance</em> and enter the closing balance from the previous accounting system. For negative balances, select <em>Amount to pay</em>, indicating the member has withdrawn more than was actually distributed:</p>

<p>Click <kbd>Create</kbd> to save.</p>

<p>Sole proprietorships require only a single capital account. Partnerships require a capital account for each partner. Trusts require one for each beneficiary. Funds require a capital account for each member. Repeat the process described until all capital accounts have been established:</p>

<p>By default, all capital accounts are combined as <em>Capital accounts</em> in the <em>Equity</em> section of the Balance Sheet:</p>

<p>Sometimes, it is necessary to rename the account. For example, if the business operates as a sole proprietorship, the account can be renamed as <em>Owner's equity</em>. Click <kbd>Edit</kbd> under <kbd>Chart of Accounts</kbd> in the <kbd>Settings</kbd> tab:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong><br>In some situations, sole proprietors need not add the complexity of capital accounts to their business records. See <a href="https://forum.manager.io/t/simple-equity-accounting-for-sole-traders-proprietors/6971">this Guide</a> for a discussion of a simpler approach to equity accounting.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sole proprietors and partnerships are unincorporated, meaning they have no shareholders. Their capital accounts can be set up as described in this Guide. But companies or corporations (terminology varies in different jurisdictions), trusts, and funds are separate legal entities. Depending on the legal structure of a business, it may be nessessary to change the classification of <em>Capital accounts</em> from <em>Equity</em> to <em>Assets</em> if they are debit balances or <em>Liabilities</em> if they are credit balances. When in doubt, consult with a local accountant to be sure. </p>

<h3>Capital subaccounts</h3>

<p>Each capital account you create automatically has the following subaccounts:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Drawings</em></li>
<li><em>Funds contributed</em></li>
<li><em>Share of profit</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Subaccounts are useful for segregating movements to and from capital accounts. Default subaccounts are sufficient for most businesses, but you can add, remove or rename subaccounts under the <kbd>Settings</kbd> tab by selecting <kbd>Capital subaccounts</kbd>:</p>

<h3><em>Drawings</em></h3>

<p><em>Drawings</em> tracks money a partner, beneficiary, or member withdraws from the business. When you transfer funds from a cash account to a member, or if the business pays a private expense on behalf of a member, the transaction should be posted to the <em>Drawings</em> subaccount: </p>

<h3><em>Funds contributed</em></h3>

<p><em>Funds contributed</em> tracks money a member has contributed to the business. When a member deposits personal funds into a business cash account, the transaction should be posted to the <em>Funds contributed</em> subaccount.</p>

<h3><em>Share of profit</em></h3>

<p><em>Share of profit</em> is used to allocate net profit  from <em>Retained earnings</em> to <em>Capital accounts</em>. Only certain types of legal entities are required to distribute profit to owners. Such distributions are often done by an accountant at the end of a financial period using journal entries:</p>

<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/295a374837fc6a44fc63fda80ffa0580565a5008" href="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/2/295a374837fc6a44fc63fda80ffa0580565a5008.png" class="lightbox" title="Screen Shot 2017-03-21 at 7.41.35 PM.png"><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/optimized/2X/2/295a374837fc6a44fc63fda80ffa0580565a5008_1_690x140.png" width="690" height="140"><div class="meta">

<p>They prevent earnings from accumulating endlessly in <em>Retained earnings</em>. Such distributions show that funds are no longer available for general business operations, but have been earmarked for the capital account owner.</p>
