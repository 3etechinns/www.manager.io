<p>Money spent in any way by a business is a <strong>payment</strong>. Before one can be recorded, at least one <a href="https://forum.manager.io/t/set-up-a-cash-account/9219">cash account must be established</a>.</p>

<h3>Basic payments</h3>

<p>Once at least one cash account exists, payments are recorded in the <kbd>Cash Accounts</kbd> tab by clicking on <kbd>Spend money</kbd>:</p>

<p>The first stage of the entry screen appears, requiring selection of the cash account from which the money will be spent. If both bank and cash on hand accounts exist, selection options will be grouped accordingly:</p>

<h3>Payments against purchase invoices</h3>

<p>Payments to suppliers against purchase invoices can be entered two ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>As a basic payment</li>
<li>From a purchase invoice</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>As a basic payment</strong></p>

<p>To enter a payment against a specific purchase invoice, post it to <em>Accounts payable</em>, the <em>Supplier</em>, and the <em>Invoice</em>:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/9/924ec728c241155540425c726601274551ef30c0.png" width="492" height="76"></p>

<p><strong><em>Partial payments</em></strong></p>

<p>When paying only part of the balance due on a purchase invoice, allocate the transaction exactly as above, but enter only the amount actually paid. Manager will apply the partial amount against the purchase invoice and show a reduced balance due. No other special steps are necessary.</p>

<p><strong><em>Payments for multiple purchase invoices</em></strong></p>

<p>When paying a supplier for multiple purchase invoices, leave the <code>Invoice</code> dropdown box blank. Manager will allocate the payment against the oldest purchase invoice with a balance due first, then the next oldest, etc. However, if the payment is designated for specific purchase invoices, add lines and designate amounts for those invoices individually.</p>

<p><strong>From a purchase invoice</strong></p>

<p>To record a payment while viewing a purchase invoice, click on <kbd>Spend money</kbd>:</p>

<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/bcd4b88fa08a2dec997e4da838eeb2af2749f851" href="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/b/bcd4b88fa08a2dec997e4da838eeb2af2749f851.png" class="lightbox" title="Screen Shot 2016-11-22 at 2.53.34 PM.png"><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/optimized/2X/b/bcd4b88fa08a2dec997e4da838eeb2af2749f851_1_690x51.png" width="690" height="51"><div class="meta">
<span class="filename">Screen Shot 2016-11-22 at 2.53.34 PM.png</span><span class="informations">709x53 13.8 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>
</div></a></div></p>

<p>A payment entry form will appear. After a cash account is selected, the remainder of the form will be prefilled with information to enter the full amount due on the purchase invoice. If the payment is for only part of the balance due, edit the amount paid by adjusting quantity or unit price.</p>

<h3>Other situations</h3>

<p>You are not restricted to using only simple expense accounts to post payments. For example, if money is paid to a business owner set up under the <kbd>Capital Accounts</kbd> tab, select the matching capital account and subaccount:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/3/396621624fedd37671bf13a661afe1ba7d3f5e34.png" width="390" height="80"></p>

<p>If a <a href="https://forum.manager.io/t/purchase-fixed-assets/9106">fixed asset is purchased</a> the transaction can be allocated as below:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/8/8ae2f5d0f2d738d89854705ba604b7da2c198202.png" width="586" height="81"></p>

<p>Employees are paid by allocating payroll amounts as follows:</p>

<p>Inventory and non-inventory items can also be directly purchased using payment forms. For more information on buying without purchase invoices, see this <a href="https://forum.manager.io/t/cash-purchases-purchasing-without-purchase-invoices/7325">Guide</a>.</p>
