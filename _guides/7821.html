<p>Money spent in any way by a business is a <strong>payment</strong>. Before one can be recorded, at least one <a href="/guides/11367">bank account</a> or <a href="/guides/9219">cash account</a> must be established. The corresponding <kbd>Bank Transactions</kbd> or <kbd>Cash Transactions</kbd> tab <a href="/guides/8865">must also be enabled</a>.</p>
<h3>Basic payments</h3>
<p>Once at least one bank or cash account exists, payments are recorded in the <kbd>Bank Transactions</kbd> or <kbd>Cash Transactions</kbd> tabs by clicking on <kbd>New Bank Transaction</kbd> or <kbd>New Cash Transaction</kbd> and selecting <em>Spend money</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong><code>Date</code></strong> is automatically filled with todayâ€™s date, but can be edited.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>Reference</code></strong> is optional for bank transactions, because the institution normally assigns any reference number. For cash transactions, Manager will automatically generate a <code>Reference</code> number when the payment is created. It will find the highest existing <code>Reference</code> and add 1.</li>
<li>Select a <strong><code>Bank account</code></strong> or <strong><code>Cash account</code></strong> (depending on whether the payment is a bank or cash payment).</li>
<li>
<strong><code>Status</code></strong> is set to <em>Cleared</em> by default for bank transactions. Another <a href="/guides/7307">Guide</a> covers cleared and pending transactions in greater detail. This field is absent for cash transactions.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>Payee</code></strong> is the person or entity to whom money is being paid.</li>

<h3>Payments against purchase invoices</h3>
<p>Payments to suppliers against purchase invoices can be entered two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a basic payment</li>
<li>From a purchase invoice</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>As a basic payment</strong></p>
<p>To enter a payment against a specific purchase invoice, post it to <em>Accounts payable</em>, the <em>Supplier</em>, and the <em>Invoice</em>:</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.manager.io/uploads/manager1/original/2X/9/924ec728c241155540425c726601274551ef30c0.png" width="492" height="76"></p>
<p><strong><em>Partial payments</em></strong></p>
<p>When paying only part of the balance due on a purchase invoice, allocate the transaction exactly as above, but enter only the amount actually paid. Manager will apply the partial amount against the purchase invoice and show a reduced balance due. No other special steps are necessary.</p>
<p><strong><em>Payments for multiple purchase invoices</em></strong></p>
<p>When paying a supplier for multiple purchase invoices, leave the <code>Invoice</code> dropdown box blank. Manager will allocate the payment against the purchase invoice with a balance due that has the oldest due date first, then the next oldest, etc. However, if the payment is designated for specific purchase invoices, add lines and designate amounts for those invoices individually.</p>
<p><strong>From a purchase invoice</strong></p>
<p>To record a payment while viewing a purchase invoice, click on <kbd>Spend money</kbd> and select the transaction type:</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.manager.io/uploads/manager1/original/2X/1/15ba25064744f45792d6e6b40a4e5d13f5462d4b.png" alt="11 AM" width="196" height="111"></p>
<p>A payment entry form will appear. Select a bank or cash account. The remainder of the form will be prefilled with information to enter the full amount due on the purchase invoice. If the payment is for only part of the balance due, edit the amount paid by adjusting quantity or unit price.</p>
<h3>Other situations</h3>
<p>You are not restricted to using only simple expense accounts to post payments. For example, if money is paid to a business owner set up under the <kbd>Capital Accounts</kbd> tab, select the matching capital account and subaccount:</p>

<p>If a <a href="/guides/9106">fixed asset is purchased</a> the transaction can be allocated as below:</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.manager.io/uploads/manager1/original/2X/8/8ae2f5d0f2d738d89854705ba604b7da2c198202.png" width="586" height="81"></p>
<p>Employees are paid by allocating payroll amounts as follows:</p>

<p>Inventory and non-inventory items can also be directly purchased using payment forms. For more information on buying without purchase invoices, see this <a href="/guides/7325">Guide</a>.</p>
