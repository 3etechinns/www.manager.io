<p><strong>Themes</strong> change the overall design and presentation of forms and documents displayed or printed by Manager. They provide a unified look for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Payments, receipts, and transfer vouchers</li>
<li>Expense claims</li>
<li>Sales quotes</li>
<li>Sales and purchase orders</li>
<li>Sales and purchase invoices</li>
<li>Debit and credit notes</li>
<li>Delivery notes and goods receipts</li>
<li>Inventory transfers</li>
<li>Production orders</li>
<li>Payslips</li>
<li>Journal entries</li>
<li>Customer and supplier statements</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong><br>Other than customer and supplier statements, themes do not affect the layout or design of reports.</p></blockquote>

<h3>In-built theme</h3>

<p>Manager includes one in-built theme, named <em>Plain</em>. This theme cannot be edited or deleted. But it can be customized with unique business information, standard terms and conditions, and a logo in the upper right corner. The title of the particular transaction form being displayed or printed appears at the upper left, as in this sales invoice:</p>

<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/12c5ca2446edf316c6435accfbe9bbd016cac69e" href="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/1/12c5ca2446edf316c6435accfbe9bbd016cac69e.png" class="lightbox" title="Screen Shot 2017-07-03 at 12.08.06 PM.png"><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/optimized/2X/1/12c5ca2446edf316c6435accfbe9bbd016cac69e_1_600x500.png" width="600" height="500"><div class="meta">

</div></a></div></p>

<p>By design, Manager minimizes displayed information. So fields not populated do not show. For example, in the illustration above, inventory codes are not present, so the <code>Code</code> column is not displayed. The in-built theme also incorporates Paid in Full and Overdue "stamps" that display at the bottom of sales invoices when appropriate.</p>

<h3>Other free themes</h3>

<p>To keep Manager small, other themes are not built into the program, but are available for download at <a href="http://www.manager.io/themes">http://www.manager.io/themes</a>. New themes will continue to be added on the website.</p>

<h3>Installing a new theme</h3>

<p>If you'd like Manager to use a different theme, click on the image of a theme you like on the website:</p>

</div></a></div></p>

<p>A large screenshot of the theme, populated with representative data, will appear. Beneath it you will see a code window:</p>

          </a>


<p>Themes are coded in the Liquid language. Select and copy the code for the new theme. Go back to the Manager window, select the <kbd>Settings</kbd> tab, then <kbd>Themes</kbd> and <kbd>New Theme</kbd>:</p>

<p>Give your new theme a <strong><code>Name</code></strong>, paste the copied code into the window, then click <kbd>Create</kbd>:</p>

          </a>


<p>Your new theme will be listed when viewing <kbd>Themes</kbd>:</p>

<p>Once you have added your first theme, a <kbd>Switch Theme</kbd> dropdown menu appears in the top-right corner when viewing any affected form. Use it to select a theme:</p>

<p>The form being viewed will quickly switch to the new look:</p>

</div></a></div></p>

<p>Manager will remember the theme you have chosen for a particular form. However, all new forms will, by default, use the <em>Plain</em> theme unless you change them.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong><br>All features of Manager are not supported by all themes. Most do not include the Paid in Full and Overdue stamps for sales invoices without further modification. Be sure any theme you choose meets all your needs before committing to use it. (The in-built <em>Plain</em> theme supports all features.)</p></blockquote>
