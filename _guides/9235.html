<p><strong>Bank reconciliation</strong> is the process of verifying your records of transactions posted to cash accounts maintained by financial institutions against records of the institutions. (The term <em>bank</em> is used generically to refer to any institution from which you receive or can obtain statements, whether by mail or electronically.) To avoid potential problems caused by undiscovered errors, you should reconcile your bank accounts regularly.</p>

<p>Go to the <kbd>Reports</kbd> tab and click <kbd>Bank Reconciliation Statement</kbd>:</p>

<p>Set the date you will reconcile transactions until, usually the date of the statement. Select the bank account:</p>

<p>Click <kbd>Create</kbd> to save the report. This will create a bank reconciliation statement to guide you through the bank reconciliation steps:</p>

<p>Click <kbd>View</kbd>. Before the statement appears, you must enter the closing balance per the bank statement on the bank reconciliation date:</p>

<p>Click <kbd>Update</kbd>. If Manager's figures agree with the bank statement, the account reconciles and the Bank Reconciliation Statement will appear:</p>

<p>The statement will show:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>Closing balance as per bank statement</code> at the top (which you can still correct by clicking on the blue amount).</li>
<li>List of pending deposits and pending payments. </li>
<li>
<code>Closing balance as per balance sheet</code>, representing the actual bank balance as recorded in Manager.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the figures disagree, Manager will show you a screen to help with the bank reconciliation process. Exact contents of this screen may vary, depending on the problem detected. You will first be asked to double-check the closing balance as per the bank statement.</p>

<p>You may be asked to asked to confirm status of pending transactions:</p>

<p>If you make corrections, Managers suggestions may change. If the problem does not resolve, you may be presented with a list of transactions since your last reconciliation. Depending on how often you reconcile, the list of transactions can be quite lengthy. Manager might break down the transactions into smaller segments to make it easier to check against your bank statement. To do that, Manager may ask for interim closing balances as per your bank statement. </p>

<p>It's usually most efficient to keep providing new closing balances as long as you are asked for them. Manager will use this information to pinpoint the specific days you don't reconcile. Instead of checking a whole month of transactions at once, you will only need to reconcile one day at a time and only days that don't reconcile.</p>

<p>When you compare transactions from the list to your bank statement, use the <kbd>Edit</kbd> button to correct or delete transactions as required. If a transaction is included in your bank statement but not in Manager, use the applicable <kbd>Spend money</kbd>, <kbd>Receive money</kbd> or <kbd>Transfer money</kbd> button to record it.</p>

<p>Once you resolve all issues, your reconciliation statement will appear and the <code>Status</code> of the bank reconciliation statement will indicate <code>Reconciled</code> when viewing the list of bank reconciliation statements:</p>
