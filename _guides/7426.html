<p>A <strong>debit note</strong> records an adjustment by a <a href="/guides/7020">supplier</a> of the amount owed to that supplier by a business. Typically, a debit note is created in response to a credit note received by the business from a supplier, although not all supplier credits are formally documented. Debit notes are internal; that is, they are not normally provided to the supplier. They might be for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Return of goods</li>
<li>Adjustment (refund) of price for goods or services previously delivered</li>
<li>Overpayment of amounts billed</li>
</ul>

<p>A debit note makes all necessary corrections to inventory, expense, and tax accounts. It does not record actual receipt of money from the supplier, but only adjusts the supplier's balance in <em>Accounts payable</em>. A debit note can be created regardless of whether the supplier has yet been paid for the goods or services. </p>

<table style="background-color: #F2F9FF; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px"><tr><td style="font-size: 48px; opacity: 0.25; padding: 20px; padding-top: 15px; padding-right: 0px; vertical-align: top"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></td><td style="padding: 20px"><p><strong>NOTE</strong><br>A debit note should not normally be used if the original transaction was a <a href="/guides/7325">cash purchase</a>, because the purchase will not have been recorded in the supplier's subaccount in <em>Accounts payable</em>. In such situations, a direct receipt should usually be entered via a <kbd>Receive money</kbd> transaction under the <kbd>Cash Accounts</kbd> tab. In these cases, enter quantities returned to the supplier as negative numbers. However, if the cash seller has also been defined as a supplier and offers an account credit rather than a cash refund, a debit note may be used.</p></td></tr></table>

<p>The first stage of the debit note entry screen appears:</p>

<p>By default, today's date is prepopulated. Normally, this date is edited to match the date of the supplier's credit note. Customarily, the supplier's credit note reference number is entered in the <code>Reference</code> field.</p>

<p>A <a href="/guides/7020">previously defined supplier</a> must be selected in the dropdown box before proceeding. Line items being returned or adjusted can be completed semi-automatically by selecting predefined inventory or non-inventory items in the <code>Item</code> field and entering quantities. Or, they may be entered manually. Applicable tax codes can be selected. Additional lines can be added 1, 5, 10, or 20 at a time. When a corresponding purchase invoice has previously been entered, it can be selected in the <code>Invoice</code> field. All data can be edited before the debit note is completed:</p>

<h3>Receiving a refund</h3>

<p>If a supplier refunds the credit balance, <kbd>Receive money</kbd> into a cash account, allocating the refund to <em>Accounts payable</em> and the supplier's subaccount. When a cash refund is recorded, the balance of <em>Accounts payable</em> to the supplier will move in the positive direction:</p>
