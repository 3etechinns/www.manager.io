<p>Many financial transactions are completed, or <strong>cleared</strong>, by the time they are entered in Manager. No further financial activity will occur. Some examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="/guides/7321">Cash sales</a> to customers, with received funds held in cash till</li>
<li>
<a href="/guides/7325">Cash payments</a> to merchants from a petty cash fund</li>
<li><a href="/guides/9240">Imported bank transactions</a></li>
<li>
<a href="/guides/9650">Transfers</a> between company accounts within the same financial institution</li>
</ul>
<p>Others involve delay before all financial activity is complete. Examples of these <strong>pending</strong> transactions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cheques written to suppliers or employees that have not yet been presented for payment</li>
<li>Credit card charges not yet showing on the card statement</li>
<li>Receipts from customers not yet deposited with the bank</li>
<li>Deposits to bank accounts not yet available for withdrawal</li>
<li>Transfers between bank accounts in different institutions not yet finalized (whether by cheque, electronic or wire transfer, or other means)</li>
</ul>
<p>Manager can easily track status of bank account deposits and withdrawals, including dates of both initial transactions and eventual clearance. Using this feature, you can quickly determine how much of your bank account funds are unobligated, that is, actually available to spend. Likewise, you can determine whether or not money received is actually accessible.</p>
<h3>Cleared transactions</h3>
<p>By default, all new receipts and payments in the <kbd>Bank Transactions</kbd> tab are <em>Cleared</em>. For example, a receipt from a customer automatically shows <em>Cleared</em> in the <code>Status</code> field:</p>

<p>If desired, the clearance date can be entered:</p>

<p>All such transactions will appear under the <code>Statement balance</code> column for a bank account in the <kbd>Bank Accounts</kbd> tab:</p>

<h3>Pending transactions</h3>
<p>When money has been received, but perhaps not deposited in the bank, the transaction can be marked as <em>Pending</em>:</p>

<p>Similarly, until a cheque has been presented and paid by the bank or a credit card charge is posted to a statement, it can be shown as <em>Pending</em>:</p>

<p>When transfers are made between accounts in the <kbd>Inter Account Transfers</kbd> tab, both the outgoing and incoming transactions can be annotated separately (if they involve bank accounts):</p>
<p><img src="https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business2/uploads/manager1/original/2X/8/808f182fc619945b4e92664e0b77ab95235e28cb.png" width="628" height="363"></p>
<p>If any pending deposits or withdrawals exist, they will automatically be shown in separate columns under <kbd>Bank Accounts</kbd>:</p>
<p><img src="https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business2/uploads/manager1/original/2X/a/a4c8b3fc6e09f07aca2d96e1e8edfce6ca675ea3.png"></p>
<p>A <a href="/guides/9235">Bank Reconciliation Statement</a> can be produced adjusting an account statement for pending deposits and withdrawals. This can help ensure bank records match accounting records in Manager.</p>
<h3>Clearing a pending transaction</h3>
<p>Once a pending transaction has cleared on the records of the financial institution, drill down by clicking the blue balance under <code>Pending deposits</code> or <code>Pending withdrawal</code>s for the bank account involved in the <kbd>Bank Accounts</kbd> tab. Click <kbd>Edit</kbd> beside the particular transaction:</p>
<p><img src="https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business2/uploads/manager1/original/2X/b/be62e0380de6ab112c2f75859b91cc29b890a357.png"></p>
<p>Change status to <em>Cleared</em> in the dropdown <code>Status</code> box and enter the clearance date, exactly as if the transaction had been cleared when first entered. (See first illustration above.)</p>
