---
{% raw %}
<p>Many self-employed individuals primarily provide services to their customers or clients. They maintain no inventory, have no employees, pay for purchases as they are made, and operate as sole traders or proprietors (that is, they have no partners or other shareholders). Yet they need to keep accurate records of time spent and materials purchased for completion of jobs, may need to collect and remit taxes assessed on their services, and want to submit professional quotes and invoices to their customers. Examples of such individuals include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accountants, lawyers, and others providing professional services</li>
<li>Carpenters, plumbers, and repair technicians</li>
<li>Consultants</li>
<li>Freelance artists, web developers, and media developers</li>
</ul>
<p>This Guide outlines <strong>basic steps for setting up business as a self-employed services provider</strong>. Rather than furnishing detailed instructions at every phase, it links to <a href="https://www.manager.io/guides">other Manager Guides</a>. Suggestions are offered for accommodating additional needs and for further simplification.</p>
<h3>Create the business</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.manager.io/guides/9265">Create your business</a> on the <kbd>Businesses</kbd> page, which functions as the home page of the Manager application. Click <kbd>Add Business</kbd> and select <em>Create New Business</em>:</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.manager.io/uploads/manager1/original/2X/3/3528d174e7f0ca3132b49f2e9a5734eb1546f016.png" width="112" height="43"> <strong><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right" style="margin-right: 10px; color: #999; font-size: 18px; padding-top: 5px"></i></strong> <img src="https://forum.manager.io/uploads/manager1/original/2X/9/9634d6ee02da45b9bfcbc730469fdb14e5aed34e.png" width="193" height="116"></p>
<p>For purposes of illustration, this Guide will follow creation of a business named <em>Sample Consulting</em>:</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.manager.io/uploads/manager1/original/2X/a/a7adc6043f80901e8aa866dda7f188527c7de587.png" width="521" height="138"></p>
<p>Once the business has been created, a <kbd>Summary</kbd> page will appear showing four, default functional tabs and several default accounts:</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.manager.io/uploads/manager1/original/2X/e/e245cf3c2d943c12351e0868c8889cba9c7a220a.png" width="486" height="499"></p>
<p>Click on the <kbd>Settings</kbd> tab and <a href="https://www.manager.io/guides/9835">enter business details</a>. If you have one, <a href="https://www.manager.io/guides/9834">add a business logo</a>.</p>
<h3>Customize functional tabs</h3>
<p>Now enable additional functional tabs you will need for your business. Click <kbd>Customize</kbd> below the left navigation pane and <a href="https://www.manager.io/guides/8865">enable these additional tabs</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<kbd>Bank Accounts</kbd> (if you will make any transactions through a financial institution of any type)</li>
<li>
<kbd>Cash Accounts</kbd> (if you will deal with any physical coins or bills)</li>
<li><kbd>Expense Claims</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>Customers</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>Sales Quotes</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>Sales Invoices</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>Billable Time</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>Billable Expenses</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>Fixed Assets</kbd></li>
</ul>
<p>If all your work will come without needing to give customers quotes, proposals, or bids, do not enable <kbd>Sales Quotes</kbd>. If you will, for some reason, be buying from suppliers on credit, add <kbd>Purchase Invoices</kbd> to the list. If you are not sure, leave both those tabs off the list. They can easily be added later. Likewise, if you are not sure whether you will own depreciable fixed assets, do not enable that tab unless you need it later.</p>
<h3>Add bank and cash account(s)</h3>
<p>Every business needs at least one bank or cash account, even if that means your own pocket. So <a href="https://www.manager.io/guides/9219">add one or more now</a> so the business can spend and receive money. The illustration below is for a bank account, but cash accounts are set up the same way:</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.manager.io/uploads/manager1/original/2X/8/851f007be3b5ca59c72bd28d96e3663e73bdf462.png" alt="48 AM" width="552" height="186"></p>
<p>If you will have <a href="https://www.manager.io/guides/7035">a business credit card</a>, set it up now. (This example does not include one.)</p>
<h3>Set up your chart of accounts</h3>
<p>Several accounts in Manager are activated automatically only when needed. So you can see these, make the following setup entries:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <kbd>Customers</kbd> tab, <a href="https://www.manager.io/guides/7018">create a customer</a> called <em>Setup Customer</em>. Leave all fields blank except <code>Name</code>.</li>
<li>In the <kbd>Billable Time</kbd> tab, <a href="https://www.manager.io/guides/6935">create a billable time entry</a>. Choose <em>Setup Customer</em>, but leave all other fields in their default states.</li>
<li>In the <kbd>Fixed Assets</kbd> tab, <a href="https://www.manager.io/guides/9106">create a fixed asset</a>. Fill in <code>Item name</code> as <em>Setup Fixed Asset</em>. Leave all other fields blank.</li>
<li>Under <kbd>Settings</kbd> <strong><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right" style="margin-right: 10px; color: #999; font-size: 18px; padding-top: 5px"></i></strong> <kbd>Tax Codes</kbd>, <a href="https://www.manager.io/guides/8901">activate or create a tax code</a> that will apply to your services.</li>
</ul>
<table style="background-color: #F2F9FF; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px"><tr><td style="font-size: 48px; opacity: 0.25; padding: 20px; padding-top: 15px; padding-right: 0px; vertical-align: top"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></td><td style="padding: 20px">
<p><strong>Note</strong><br>
If your business will own no property qualifying as fixed assets or your services are not taxable in your jurisdiction, omit one or both of the last two setup entries above.</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Now click on <kbd>Settings</kbd>, then <kbd>Chart of Accounts</kbd>, where all active accounts will be listed:</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.manager.io/uploads/manager1/original/2X/2/280da777dbcd4053366e023fc152eb9b19017e02.png" alt="13 AM" width="388" height="499"></p>
<p>Click <kbd>Edit</kbd> next to <em>Retained earnings</em>. Change the name of this account to <em>Owner’s equity</em>. <a href="https://www.manager.io/guides/6971">This built-in account will function in the same way</a>, but the default title was more appropriate to corporate ownership structures.</p>
<p>Click <kbd>Edit</kbd> buttons next to income accounts to rename or <a href="https://www.manager.io/guides/9813">delete them</a>. Automatically created accounts cannot be deleted while their tabs are enabled. But they can be renamed. Their default names show in grey when editing. <a href="https://www.manager.io/guides/9812">Add any additional income accounts</a> you think you will need.</p>
<table style="background-color: #F6FFF2; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px"><tr><td style="font-size: 48px; opacity: 0.25; padding: 20px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; vertical-align: top"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i></td><td style="padding: 20px">
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
Because Sample Consulting expects to perform some work on an hourly basis and some on a fixed price basis, we will rename <em>Billable time - invoiced</em> to <em>Service sales - billable time</em> and <em>Sales</em> to <em>Service sales - fixed rate</em>. Since no interest-bearing accounts or investments are anticipated, we will change the <em>Interest received</em> account to <em>Other income</em>, providing a place to post miscellaneous income items.</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Lastly, <kbd>Edit</kbd> expense accounts to rename or <a href="https://www.manager.io/guides/9813">delete them</a>. Good practice is to match required expense reporting categories for tax filing in your jurisdiction. <a href="https://www.manager.io/guides/9812">Add accounts</a> if necessary.</p>
<table style="background-color: #F6FFF2; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px"><tr><td style="font-size: 48px; opacity: 0.25; padding: 20px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; vertical-align: top"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i></td><td style="padding: 20px">
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
Donations are not allowable business expenses in Sample Consulting’s jurisdiction, so we will delete the <em>Donations</em> account. Computer equipment is not treated differently from other tools and equipment, so will rename <em>Computer equipment</em> as <em>Equipment</em>. The owner of Sample Consulting plans to work from home, so we will change <em>Rent</em> to <em>Other expenses</em>.<br>
<br> With all changes mentioned, Sample Consulting’s chart of accounts is complete. It’s <kbd>Summary</kbd> page now looks like this:<br>
<br><img src="https://forum.manager.io/uploads/manager1/original/2X/3/3e9a141e7f781b33db8731149185828fcda6e3b2.png" alt="56 AM" width="399" height="500"></p>
</td></tr></table>
<h3>Clear setup entries</h3>
<p>Although they have no financial impact on your records, you should clear the setup entries. (These were only made so you could see and edit all accounts.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Delete the billable time entry by clicking <kbd>Edit</kbd> in the <kbd>Billable Time</kbd> tab.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.manager.io/guides/9451">Delete</a> <em>Setup Customer</em>. (You will not be able to delete this customer unless you have first deleted the billable time entry above.)</li>
<li>Delete <em>Setup Fixed Asset</em> by clicking <kbd>Edit</kbd> in the <kbd>Fixed Assets</kbd> tab.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some accounts will temporarily disappear from your <kbd>Summary</kbd> and chart of accounts. They will return when real entries are made.</p>
<table style="background-color: #F2F9FF; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px"><tr><td style="font-size: 48px; opacity: 0.25; padding: 20px; padding-top: 15px; padding-right: 0px; vertical-align: top"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></td><td style="padding: 20px">
<p><strong>Note</strong><br>
As long as your setup tax code was one you will actually use, leave it in place.</p>
</td></tr></table>
<h3>Begin operations</h3>
<p>Manager is now configured to handle your business. Among other things, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send <a href="https://www.manager.io/guides/7238">sales quotes</a>
</li>
<li>Purchase or record <a href="https://www.manager.io/guides/9106">fixed assets</a>
</li>
<li>Record and invoice <a href="https://www.manager.io/guides/6935">billable time</a> and <a href="https://www.manager.io/guides/5503">expenses</a>
</li>
<li>Send <a href="https://www.manager.io/guides/7178">sales invoices</a>
</li>
<li>Issue <a href="https://www.manager.io/guides/7022">customer statements</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.manager.io/guides/7821">Spend</a> and <a href="https://www.manager.io/guides/7820">receive</a> money</li>
<li>Generate <a href="https://www.manager.io/guides/7468">accounting reports</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The next step is to <a href="https://www.manager.io/guides/7018">enter any expected customers</a>. Others will hopefully follow. Make other transaction entries as they occur.</p>
