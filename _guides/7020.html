<p>A <strong>Supplier</strong> in Manager is an entity (person, business, or other organization) with whom you have or plan to have an <em>Accounts payable</em> relationship. Suppliers in Manager are actually subaccounts of <em>Accounts payable</em>. You must first create a Supplier before you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enter a purchase invoice corresponding to a received sales invoice</li>
<li>Buy on credit for future payment</li>
<li>Create a supplier statement showing balances due or summarizing past transactions</li>
<li>Generate a purchase order</li>
<li>Make a deposit or advance against future work or delivery of goods by someone else</li>
<li>Issue a debit note for return of goods to someone else</li>
<li>Track your complete purchase and payment history with another entity</li>
</ul>

<p>Not everyone from whom you buy must necessarily be a Supplier. You can make a cash purchase involving immediate payment without creating a Supplier simply by entering a name as <code>Payee</code> when <a href="/guides/7821">spending money from a cash account</a>. But such transactions will not be recorded in a history for that Payee, even if the Payee is already defined as a Supplier. Examples of purchases where a Supplier might not be needed include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Purchases by cash or check from a merchant</li>
<li>Timely payment of monthly utility bills</li>
<li>Credit card payments for business expenses</li>
</ul>

<p>Complete the entry. Enter the name of the Supplier to which you will render payment and the payment address. This information will appear on purchase invoices and similar documents.</p>

<p>Your Supplier will now appear in the <kbd>Suppliers</kbd> tab. Suppliers are listed in alphabetical order according to their names. Use scrolling, paging, and search functions to find them. The listing shows the number of purchase invoices created for a Supplier and the Supplier's <em>Accounts payable</em> balance. Click on blue numbers for more details of any column.</p>
