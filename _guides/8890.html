<p>Accounting data for businesses  in Manager can be backed up, restored, and transferred using a backup file. A <strong>backup</strong> for a business stores all information necessary to completely recreate its accounting records, including transactions, customer and supplier information, inventory status, reports, attachments, as well as custom themes and settings. Using backups, you can: </p>

<ul>
<li>Recover data after it is lost, as when a storage drive fails</li>
<li>Recover data from an earlier time, for example, before someone began making entry errors</li>
<li>Transfer data between computers</li>
<li>Build redundant data caches</li>
<li>Migrate data to different editions of the program (desktop, server, or cloud)</li>
</ul>

<p>A backup includes data of only one business. If you have multiple accounting entities, each must be backed up separately. If desired, these backups can be to separate locations. And a single business can be backed up to multiple locations.</p>

<h3>Making a backup</h3>

<p>As long as new accounting data is being recorded, backups should be made frequently. A general guideline is to back up your data often enough that you would be willing <strong>and able</strong> to re-enter recent data to bring your records up to date. For high-volume businesses, that realistically means backing up at least daily. For lower-volume entities, weekly or monthly backups might suffice, as long as necessary records would be available if data loss occurs.</p>

<p>Creating a backup file is very simple. Under the <kbd>Businesses</kbd> tab, click on the name of the business you are backing up. (This step is unnecessary if you are already within the business.) </p>

<p>Then click the <kbd>Backup</kbd> button at the top right of the Manager window.</p>

<p>Depending on your operating system, the software will offer to save the backup file somewhere on your local drive. Generally, you should choose a different location (see below). In this example, the backup is for a business named Northwind Traders.</p>

<p>The backup file name will contain a date stamp to indicate when the backup was created. Once you make multiple backups, it will be easy to see when individual backup files were generated:</p>

<p>You should store backups separately from your computer. That way, if the computer fails, the backup will remain intact. Choose an appropriate backup medium and location, considering cost, convenience, and the value you place on your accounting data (including the effort required to recreate it). For protection from hazards or theft, the backup should aso be kept at a separate physical location. Some possibilities include:</p>

<ul>
<li>USB flash drive</li>
<li>External drive</li>
<li>Network-connected drive</li>
<li>Writable CDs or DVDs</li>
<li>Cloud storage service (<em>e.g.</em>, Dropbox, OneDrive, or iCloud)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Restoring from backup</h3>

<p>Restore a business from backup under the <kbd>Businesses</kbd> tab by clicking <kbd>Add Business</kbd> and selecting <em>Import Business</em>:</p>

<p>The next screen may look slightly different, depending on your operating system. Regardless, browse to the location of your stored backup and select the file you want to import. In the example below, the backup <em>Northwind Traders (2016-10-25).manager</em> has been chosen:</p>

<p>Click <kbd>Import Business</kbd> to complete the process. You will be returned to the <kbd>Businesses</kbd> tab listing your businesses:</p>

<p>Click on the imported business to open it so you can verify it was restored properly:</p>

<table style="background-color: #F2F9FF; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px"><tr><td style="font-size: 48px; opacity: 0.25; padding: 20px; padding-top: 15px; padding-right: 0px; vertical-align: top"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></td><td style="padding: 20px"><p><strong>Note</strong><br>The business name at the top of the Manager window retains the same date stamp as the backup file you imported. But forms in the data file keep the trading name entered at <kbd>Settings</kbd> <i class="fa fa-hand-o-right" style="margin-right: 10px; color: #999; font-size: 18px; padding-top: 5px"></i> <kbd>Business Details</kbd>. This can be useful for differentiating versions of restored businesses. If you do not want the date stamp to show, you can rename the data file either before or after importing it to remove the date stamp.</p></td></tr></table>

<table style="background-color: #ffffdb; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px"><tr><td style="font-size: 48px; opacity: 0.25; padding: 20px; padding-top: 15px; padding-right: 0px; vertical-align: top"><i class="fa fa-warning"></i></td><td style="padding: 20px"><p><strong>Caution</strong><br>Manager will not prevent adding or importing businesses with identical names. To avoid confusion, such as when renaming and restoring a backup file by eliminating the date stamp, consider removing other businesses with the same name from the <kbd>Businesses</kbd> tab first. (See instructions in <a href="/guides/9123">another Guide</a>.)</p></td></tr></table>

<h3>Transferring data</h3>

<p>A backup file can also be used to transfer accounting data between computers or editions of the program. The <kbd>Backup</kbd> button works exactly the same way on any platform. Follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Choose a backup destination accessible to all computers involved in the transfer.</p></li>
<li><p>Back up the business to the backup destination.</p></li>
<li><p>Install Manager on the computer to which the data is being transferred, or access the server or cloud edition of the program via a browser on that machine.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the <kbd>Add Business</kbd> function to import the business to the new computer's or browser's list of businesses.</p></li>
</ol>

<table style="background-color: #ffffdb; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px"><tr><td style="font-size: 48px; opacity: 0.25; padding: 20px; padding-top: 15px; padding-right: 0px; vertical-align: top"><i class="fa fa-warning"></i></td><td style="padding: 20px"><p><strong>Caution</strong><br>New versions of Manager can open files created by older versions of the program. But sometimes, in doing so, they modify the data structure to incorporate new features. Therefore, older versions of the program cannot necessarily import and open backups from newer versions of the program. Therefore, be sure all versions of the program on all machines involved in data transfers are the same. And be aware, if transferring to or from the cloud edition, the cloud edition is automatically updated.</p></td></tr></table>
