<p>Procedures for emailing transaction forms and reports from Manager are described in <a href="/guides/10643">another Guide</a>. If you can’t send emails from Manager, the first thing you should try is updating to the latest version. The issue causing your problem could have been a software bug that has already been fixed.</p>
<p>If upgrading doesn’t solve the problem, we need to dive into your <kbd>Email Settings</kbd> under the<kbd>Settings</kbd> tab:</p>

<p>By default, Manager will send emails using an in-built SMTP server. As long as you’re connected to the Internet, this option should always work. If it doesn’t, and you are using the latest version, there could be a bug which should be reported to us on the <a href="https://forum.manager.io/">Forum</a>.</p>
<p>If you have checked the box to <code>Use custom SMTP server</code>, uncheck the option and click <kbd>Update</kbd>. Then test the email function again. If your emails start working, the problem is with your custom SMTP server settings. Your <code>Username</code>, <code>Host</code>, <code>Port</code> or <code>Password</code> could be invalid. You need to check with your SMTP provider to determine the correct settings.</p>
<p>Currently, Manager doesn’t support port <em>465</em>. So try different port, such as <em>587</em>. Most SMTP servers will support both ports, so this is generally not an issue.</p>
<p>If you encounter other problems, post them in a <strong>new topic</strong> on the Forum. Be as specific as possible, including information on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manager edition (desktop, server, or cloud)</li>
<li><a href="/guides/10396">Software version</a></li>
<li>Your operating system</li>
<li>Screen shots of any error messages</li>
<li>A screen shot of your <kbd>Email Settings</kbd> page (obscure personal information)</li>
</ul>
