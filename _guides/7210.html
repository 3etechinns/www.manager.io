<p>A <strong>purchase order</strong> is sent to suppliers to order goods or services. It authorizes the supplier to deliver items at listed prices and quantities by a specified date. Legally, it may be considered an offer to purchase which, if accepted by the supplier for the consideration enumerated, forms the basis of a contract.</p>
<p>Unlike most records in Manager, purchase orders have no financial or inventory impact. They do not involve actual provision of services, movement of inventory, or payment of money. Accordingly, they can be used for a variety of purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internal requests for purchase authorization</li>
<li>Documentation of order pricing</li>
<li>Inventory planning</li>
<li>Supplier communication</li>
<li>Drafts of purchase or sales invoices</li>
</ul>
<h3>Enable <kbd>Purchase Orders</kbd> tab and define supplier</h3>
<p>Before creating a purchase order, enable the <kbd>Purchase Orders</kbd> tab. Below the left navigation pane, click <kbd>Customize</kbd>, check the box for <kbd>Purchase Orders</kbd>, and click <kbd>Update</kbd>:</p>

<p>Next, be sure the supplier to whom the purchase order will be sent has been <a href="/guides/7020">defined in the <code>Suppliers</code> tab</a>. Because of their wide applicability, Manager allows purchase orders to be created in five different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard method</li>
<li>By cloning</li>
<li>From sales quotes</li>
<li>From sales orders</li>
<li>From your own sales invoices</li>
</ul>
<h3>Standard method</h3>
<p>In the <kbd>Purchase Orders</kbd> tab, select <kbd>New Purchase Order</kbd>:</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.manager.io/uploads/manager1/original/2X/9/9de7e0c98aefdcd959921f493c1a870cc181732b.png" width="221" height="52"> <strong><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right" style="margin-right: 10px; color: #999; font-size: 18px; padding-top: 5px"></i></strong> <img src="https://forum.manager.io/uploads/manager1/original/2X/d/d39eeeade1901663b4c68ec6484107e97acd8c62.png" width="287" height="52"></p>
<p>Complete the purchase order form. A <strong><code>Supplier</code></strong> must be selected from the dropdown list. Line items can be entered semi-automatically by selecting inventory or non-inventory items in the <strong><code>Item</code></strong> field. Or they can be entered manually. Enter a <strong><code>Delivery Address</code></strong> if different from your normal business address. Special <strong><code>Delivery Instructions</code></strong> can be included:</p>

<p>Click <kbd>Create</kbd> when finished:</p>

<h3>By cloning</h3>
<p>Repeat purchase orders can be entered by cloning previous ones. While viewing a similar purchase order, click <kbd>Clone</kbd>. The new purchase order need not be identical to the previous one. Anything can be edited or added:</p>

<h3>From sales quotes</h3>
<p>If a sales quote was given to a customer including items that must be purchased from a supplier, a purchase order to the supplier can be generated directly from the sales quote. While viewing the quote, select <em>New Purchase Order</em> in the <kbd>Copy to</kbd> dropdown box and edit as required:</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.manager.io/uploads/manager1/original/2X/2/2b7bd0b71defeeb7d3421aff0e271ab5f5120a48.png" alt="42 PM" width="480" height="190"></p>
<p>When items on the sales quote are purchased from several suppliers, several copies can be made and inapplicable line items deleted from each supplier’s purchase order.</p>
<h3>From sales orders</h3>
<p>If a sales order was created after receiving a customer’s order, a purchase order can be created directly from it. Select <em>New Purchase Order</em> in the <kbd>Copy to</kbd> dropdown box and edit as required:</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.manager.io/uploads/manager1/original/2X/f/f38710c3fcb9e0a384102889a12e931102a69f74.png" alt="31 PM" width="481" height="170"></p>
<h3>From your own sales invoices</h3>
<p>If items are purchased only as the customer is invoiced for them (such as when inventory is shipped directly from the supplier), or if they are being purchased as part of a repeat sale, a purchase order can be generated from a sales invoice:</p>
