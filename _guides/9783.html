<p>A <strong>start date</strong> should be set only when migrating an ongoing business to Manager. The purpose of a start date is to allow closing balances from the previous accounting system to be entered as opening balances in Manager. When Manager is used from the beginning of business activities, a start date is not necessary.</p>

<p>Go to the <kbd>Settings</kbd> tab and click <kbd>Start Date</kbd>:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Notes</strong><br>Transactions dated prior to the start date will be ignored by Manager, except earlier sales and purchase invoices will be used to establish opening balances in <em>Accounts receivable</em> and <em>Accounts payable</em>, respectively.<br><br>After a start date is set, the option to enter a starting balance will appear everywhere it makes sense to do so. But, for example, the option will not be available for top-level control accounts, for which starting balances are derived from those of subaccounts. Nor can starting balances be entered for income or expense accounts, since that would imply an earlier start date.</p></blockquote>
