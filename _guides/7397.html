<p>Simplify left-pane navigation in Manager and reduce overall program complexity by enabling only those functional <a href="/guides/8865">tabs you actually need</a>. Disable tabs you don't need.</p>

<p>This simple change does more than reduce scrolling past unused tabs. It will also:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rid your balance sheet of automatically generated accounts you won't use</li>
<li>Limit options under <kbd>Settings</kbd> and <kbd>Reports</kbd> to ones related to transactions you actually enter</li>
<li>Eliminate unnecessary check boxes, data fields, and dropdown menu choices as you make entries throughout the program</li>
</ul>

<p>These benefits streamline your experience and lower training requirements for new users. For accounting newcomers, this change can mean the difference between efficient, professional record-keeping and complete frustration.</p>

<h3>Enabling tabs</h3>

<p>When a new business is created in Manager, four tabs are enabled and visible in the left navigation pane by default. These cannot be disabled, because they are needed by all businesses:</p>

<p>To add capabilities, click on the blue <kbd>Customize</kbd> link pointed to by the red arrow. A list of available modules appears. Check boxes next to desired tabs:</p>

<p>Then click <kbd>Update</kbd> at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p>Active tabs will appear in the left navigation pane. The number of records of each type will show in windows to the right of tab names:</p>

<p>Repeat the process at any time to add more tabs.</p>

<h3>Disabling tabs</h3>

<p>To disable an unused tab, click <kbd>Customize</kbd> again, uncheck the tab's box, and click <kbd>Update</kbd>. Entry forms, data fields, and reports associated with that tab will no longer be visible.</p>

<table style="background-color: #F2F9FF; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px"><tr><td style="font-size: 48px; opacity: 0.25; padding: 20px; padding-top: 15px; padding-right: 0px; vertical-align: top"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></td><td style="padding: 20px"><p><strong>Note</strong><br>Unwanted tabs can be disabled <strong>only if they contain no transactions or records</strong>. This restriction prevents accidental loss of accounting data.  To disable a tab, all entered data must first be deleted. Only data that has not been referenced by another transaction can be deleted, so disabling a tab can be tedious. So think carefully before enabling tabs. They can always be added later.</p></td></tr></table>
