<p>Reading about installing or updating Manager on macOS takes longer than doing either.</p>
<h3>Initial installation</h3>
<p>To install the desktop edition of Manager on macOS, download the program from <a href="https://www.manager.io">https://www.manager.io</a>. Click on <kbd>Free Download</kbd>, then <kbd>Download</kbd> in the Mac tile:</p>

<p>A disk image file (with a .dmg extension) will appear in your designated downloads folder:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/8/84ccee9ecf9668bfaa27fab82ca07e70f09579b7.png" width="89" height="62"></p>
<table style="background-color: #F2F9FF; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px"><tr><td style="font-size: 48px; opacity: 0.25; padding: 20px; padding-top: 15px; padding-right: 0px; vertical-align: top"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></td><td style="padding: 20px">
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Do not try to install the disk image. It will not launch Manager.</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Double-click to open the disk image. A Manager disk icon will appear:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/a/adf55f9052d800f26d36940b1b2ebd82cb92fdbd.png" width="88" height="61"></p>
<p>Open the disk folder if it does not open automatically:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/5/5e10499b021384322c5b7a649ea572ae04394478.png" width="324" height="216"></p>
<p>Drag the Manager application icon <img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/b/bb402846080594c647803e8b05ec1567c8ec0a34.png" width="50" height="48"> from the Manager disk folder into the Applications folder <img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/4/43669ce1f399654a8d99d9a69f74d1eaf6cbd0cd.png" width="64" height="51"> on the computer.</p>
<p>Installation is complete. Depending on your browser and security preferences, the first time you launch Manager, you may see a warning like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/5/547136a8e86e09925e744bb0e4224894fdbae616.png" width="417" height="160"></p>
<p>Click <kbd>Open</kbd>.</p>
<h3>Updating Manager</h3>
<p>Always <a href="/guides/8890">back up your accounting data</a> to a remote storage device before updating.</p>
<p>Do not delete or uninstall anything before updating. Update Manager in similar fashion to initial installation. After downloading the program, opening the disk image, and dragging the Manager icon to the Applications folder, the macOS  Finder will display a warning:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/3/360129c7c520062032a1449adb7a1e59dc400da8.png" width="397" height="85"></p>
<p>Selecting <kbd>Keep Both</kbd> will retain the existing version of Manager and save the new version with a number appended to the application name. This option allows you to revert to an old version if you encounter a problem with the new one. (See <strong>CAUTION</strong> below.) Both versions will appear in the Applications folder:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/9/9a1cd40c1d5a4c4aa3f41ff1a5d5370bf6eb643d.png" width="206" height="75"></p>
<p>Selecting <kbd>Stop</kbd> will terminate the installation without affecting the downloaded file.</p>
<p>Selecting <kbd>Replace</kbd> will automatically remove the old version and install the new one in its place. If an alias of Manager is permanently kept in the Dock, that alias will now launch the new version of Manager. (If both versions were kept, the Dock alias will launch the old version, because the new version has a different name.)</p>
<p>Regardless of which installation option is chosen, all versions will call data from the same data file, so no further action is required to access accounting data.</p>
<p>The first time Manager is launched after updating, the same internet download warning that appeared after initial installation may show again. As before, click <kbd>Open</kbd>.</p>
<table style="background-color: #ffffdb; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px"><tr><td style="font-size: 48px; opacity: 0.25; padding: 20px; padding-top: 15px; padding-right: 0px; vertical-align: top"><i class="fa fa-warning"></i></td><td style="padding: 20px">
<p><strong>Caution</strong><br>
Updates of Manager can always access and use older data files. But sometimes they modify the database structure. So once you have opened a business with a newer version, problems might arise if the same business is opened with an older version. If, for any reason, you need to return to an older version of Manager, <a href="/guides/8890">restore the business from a backup file</a> that predates the update.</p>
