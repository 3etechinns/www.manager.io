**Discounts can be applied or indicated** on transaction forms related to sales, purchases, and refunds. These include:

* Sales quotes
* Sales orders
* Sales invoices
* Credit notes
* Purchase orders
* Purchase invoices
* Debit notes

The option lets you show customers discounts you are extending. It also lets you record how much of a discount, if any, a supplier has extended to you.

The `Discount` column is not normally displayed to save space. Where discounts can be applied, a checkbox appears on the entry form:

If the checkbox is activated, you can choose between _Percentage_ or _Exact amount_ options:

Selecting the _Percentage_ option will add a `Discount` column where you will be able to enter the percentage.

Choosing the _Exact amount_ option allows you to enter a fixed amount.

> **Note**
Although the checkbox activates the column for the entire form, discounts must be entered line item by line item.
