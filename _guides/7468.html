<p>Manager includes many built-in <strong>reports</strong> to summarize, analyze, and present transaction data. Access them in the <kbd>Reports</kbd> tab in the left navigation pane:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/6/684939800096876437d21aacba406e5cb57957aa.png" width="181" height="52"></p>

<h3>Enabling reports</h3>

<p>In general, reports are available to users whenever <a href="/guides/8865">tabs related to them are enabled</a>. By default, when a new business is added in Manager, a few tabs are already enabled, so a few reports common to all businesses can be generated:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/a/a3ed2aa7d900a058c8fd84689b0401f084988f11.png"></p>

<p>As more tabs are enabled, more reports are available. For example, when <kbd>Customers</kbd> and <kbd>Suppliers</kbd> tabs are enabled, aging reports and statements can be produced:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/5/52ac3c2c2db702fbc37cfb3094d29e3f54cfe6fd.png" width="338" height="213"></p>

<p>Reports are available related to tax codes, fixed assets, inventory, expense claims, capital accounts, and other aspects of accounting.</p>

<h3>Creating reports</h3>

<p>Begin creating a new report by clicking on the report's name under the <kbd>Reports</kbd> tab. Then, in all cases but one, click <kbd>New Report</kbd>. (The exception is <kbd>Custom Reports</kbd>, which is not covered by this Guide.) Depending on which report is being created, various fields will appear. Some have default content, shown in grey. This content can be overwritten to customize a report. Other fields, such as dates, may be required. Some reports offer options for adding explanatory information. For example, a new Cash Summary entry screen is shown below:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/5/50bc3aeb9ced95f831ef057310d11cddee51790b.png" width="429" height="439"></p>

<p>Some reports are created in stages. As an example, a Customer Statement requires selection of the statement type (<em>Unpaid invoices</em> or all <em>Transactions</em>), then an ending date:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/7/76a6c24dd184456e69859f401905cdabba62fb34.png" width="223" height="248"> <strong><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right" style="margin-right: 10px; color: #999; font-size: 18px; padding-top: 5px"></i></strong><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/6/68c349157a03e36b36a8f4bb4011c7189bc1f2c0.png" width="189" height="247"></p>

<p>When <kbd>Next</kbd> is clicked, a list of customers appears:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/a/ac9f952aa77731d3d7e8afff1c2c1b155feabfb3.png" width="396" height="189"></p>

<p>Click <kbd>View</kbd> to see the statement of the desired customer.</p>

<p>For some reports, comparative columns can be added. These can be useful for comparing current performance with past accounting periods. Note that columns can be named and their order adjusted by dragging the double-arrow symbols to the left of column names up or down. The top-listed column will appear at the left on the report in <strong>bold type</strong>. Other comparative columns will appear to the right of that column:</p>

<p>The foregoing setup produces the following Balance Sheet:</p>

<p>Occasionally, an option exists to set the end or as-of date as <em>Today</em>. When that choice is selected, the report will always be up to date when viewed. A custom date can also be entered:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/4/42a44ab3a022349489eba466739a86f73e455f02.png" width="149" height="226"> <strong>OR</strong> <img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/3/3b46f2963ff02a5740cde52f3a42a3c2fd4e84ac.png" width="229" height="159"></p>

<p>Reports that are simple lists can be exported for further manipulation in a spreadsheet by clicking <img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/7/71a300279e16458853e24d2106c60d246e6dc13f.png" width="49" height="24"> at the bottom of the screen.</p>

<h3>Saving and editing reports</h3>

<p>Most reports can be saved. (Customer and Supplier Statements cannot, because they change day to day.) Every report that can be is automatically saved when <kbd>Create</kbd> is clicked. Frequently used reports are then readily available without creating new ones. In fact, it may be convenient to define common reports for a full accounting period (such as through the end of a year). A report defined that way will be accurate through the current date whenever viewed, until the end of the accounting period. Of course, the displayed end date may be wrong.</p>

<p>Saved reports can be edited after clicking the <kbd>Edit</kbd> button to the left of a report in the list:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/7/7ad12c2c88dec29315bd88a7b5ac8e3831b06a0a.png" width="490" height="156"></p>

<p>Click <kbd>Update</kbd> after editing to save the revised report. Saved reports can also be deleted when no longer needed by clicking <kbd>Delete</kbd> at the bottom of the edit screen.</p>

<table style="background-color: #F2F9FF; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px"><tr><td style="font-size: 48px; opacity: 0.25; padding: 20px; padding-top: 15px; padding-right: 0px; vertical-align: top"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></td><td style="padding: 20px"><p><strong>Note</strong><br>Manager does not actually save reports as documents or files. It stores definitions of reports, including necessary dates, titles, column headings, etc. When a saved report is viewed, Manager actually creates it in real time from the stored definition. Thus, a deleted report can always be recreated, because Manager never deletes the underlying transactions, only the information needed for a particular display. And if report formats are improved as Manager is updated, all saved reports will automatically be updated, too.</p></td></tr></table>
