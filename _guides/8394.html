<p>Manager stores all business information, accounting data, custom themes, and attachments in a separate data file for each business. By default, these data files are saved in the <strong>application data folder</strong>. No accounting, business, or user information is stored in the application itself. The default location for application data depends on your operating system and edition, but is the same for all businesses you create.</p>
<table style="background-color: #F2F9FF; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px"><tr><td style="font-size: 48px; opacity: 0.25; padding: 20px; padding-top: 15px; padding-right: 0px; vertical-align: top"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></td><td style="padding: 20px">
<p><strong>Note</strong><br>
When using the desktop edition, business data files can be stored outside the application data folder and opened directly without first launching the Manager application. This is done by creating a <a href="/guides/8890">backup file</a> in the desired storage location. Business data files stored this way are not also copied to the application data folder, so information below <strong>does not apply</strong> to them.</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Over time, data storage schemes for Manager have changed to accommodate new program features. Sometimes, an update requires new data files to be created. This happens automatically when the new version of Manager is launched. No action by the user is ever necessary.</p>
<p>Relic data files are not normally deleted. These obsolete data files and/or folders are harmless and can safely be left in place. By modern standards, they are not large, and do not consume much storage capacity. However, they can be identified and deleted, if desired.</p>
<h3>Finding your application data</h3>
<p>To discover the location of your application data, click <kbd>Preferences</kbd> in the top menu bar. To view your application data, navigate to the folder shown. Depending on your operating system and preferences, the folder may be hidden from normal view. So you may need to copy the location and paste it into your operating systemâ€™s file search function.</p>
<p>Once at the data folder, you should see files like these:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><code>00000000000000000000000000000000.manager</code></strong> is an SQLite database holding a list of businesses, users, and global preferences. This file is generated automatically the first time you launch Manager and updated as businesses and users are added or removed or global preferences are changed. It contains no accounting data. If the file is deleted, the program will generate an empty version of it. Businesses can be repopulated into the file by <a href="/guides/6263">restoring them from backup</a>.</li>
<li>Files with long, alphanumeric names like <strong><code>69703781b9284b1684e494fdd5510cb8.manager</code></strong> are generated for each business added. Characters in the file name are not related to the name of the business. All accounting data, customer and supplier information, custom themes, settings, and attachments for a business reside in this file. For privacy reasons, no data from any business appears in the file of any other.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>data</code></strong> stores the application data folder path. If you have an older version of Manager or have never changed the application data folder location, this file may be missing. If Manager needs it, the program will generate it automatically.</li>
<li>Another file with an alphanumeric name like <strong><code>238097db79f84dc5a44a0c6f8aa04e6c.manager</code></strong> is generated or updated automatically as required. This file contains information about audit trails. If deleted, this file will be automatically regenerated if it is needed.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>size</code></strong> (for desktop installations) stores the window size when the application is closed.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>password</code></strong> (for server installations) stores the administrator account password</li>
</ul>
<p>So if you have two businesses, your file structure might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>00000000000000000000000000000000.manager
69703781b9284b1684e494fdd5510cb8.manager
76cf56919daf4a3780196f51614b327b.manager
data
238097db79f84dc5a44a0c6f8aa04e6c.manager
size
</code></pre>
<p>The current version of Manager does not use or create any other files or folders.</p>
<h3>Identifying current business files</h3>
<p>Since Manager does not automatically delete files for removed businesses or obsolete data structures, long-time users who have been through several updates or  removed businesses may need to identify which files with alphanumeric names are currently in use. One way is to enter a transaction in a business and check immediately which file was most recently modified. Files that change only with entries to a single business are the accounting files for those businesses. Make note of the modified files and corresponding businesses. A file that changes with entries to all businesses is the audit trail file. Files not modified by any active business are obsolete.</p>
<p>Another way to determine which files are active is to open them directly. (This capability became available with Manager version 17.10.0.) Examine transactions in various tabs to see whether the file is up to date.</p>
<table style="background-color: #ffffdb; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px"><tr><td style="font-size: 48px; opacity: 0.25; padding: 20px; padding-top: 15px; padding-right: 0px; vertical-align: top"><i class="fa fa-warning"></i></td><td style="padding: 20px">
<p><strong>Caution</strong><br>
Do not make any entries in a file you have opened directly as you identify current business files. Such entries will complicate both data identification and recovery efforts you may be undertaking. For more information on directly opening data files, see <a href="/guides/12280">this Guide</a>.</p>
</td></tr></table>
<h3>Removing unnecessary data</h3>
<p>After identifying all current business files among those with alphanumeric names, you can remove unnecessary files from the application data folder. To be safe, do not delete them yet. Move the following file types to a safe location:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><code>00000000000000000000000000000000</code></strong> (without the <code>*.manager</code> extension) is an obsolete index the program ignores.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>recent</code></strong> is a relic file formerly used in the desktop edition to store a list of recently opened businesses.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>language</code></strong> is a relic file that was used to store settings from multiple businesses.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>secret</code></strong> is a relic file.</li>
<li>Files with <strong><code>.manager-journal</code></strong> extensions are temporary SQLite rollback journals created when database revisions are necessary. They help prevent database corruption. The application normally deletes them when they are no longer needed. They remain only if an overly aggressive backup process interrupted a file conversion.</li>
<li>Files with plain-language names like <strong><code>Northwind Traders.manager</code></strong> were generated automatically by the desktop edition under a prior file naming scheme.</li>
<li>
<strong>Folders</strong>, regardless of their names, are relics of obsolete data structures.</li>
<li>Files with alphanumeric names like <strong><code>f565db9ce66044188729588d6f5f2269.manager</code></strong> determined <em>not</em> to be associated with active businesses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Relaunch Manager and verify all active businesses are still present and contain expected accounting and custom theme data. If an active business file was moved from the application data folder by accident, Manager will regenerate a file with the required name. However, the recreated business will have only default tabs and no accounting data. The <a href="/guides/9123">recreated business should be removed</a>. The associated data file should be deleted. (It will probably be the most recently created file in the folder.) The previously removed file with the same name should be moved back into the application data folder.</p>
<p>When satisfied all businesses are present and include expected data, delete removed files from their temporary location.</p>
