<p>If you have a customer who is also a supplier, you may sometimes have simultaneous, outstanding sales and purchase invoices with the same business. In Manager, all sales invoices are subaccounts of <em>Accounts receivable</em>, while purchase invoices are subaccounts of <em>Accounts payable</em>. This lets you easily <strong>offset outstanding sales and purchase invoices</strong> against one another using contra journal entries.</p>
<table style="background-color: #F6FFF2; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px"><tr><td style="font-size: 48px; opacity: 0.25; padding: 20px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; vertical-align: top"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i></td><td style="padding: 20px">
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
You have a customer who owes you 1,000 from a sales invoice:<br>

<br>At the same time you have made a credit purchase for 200 from this same business (as a supplier):<br>

<br>Instead of paying your customer 200 while receiving 1000, you can make a contra entry decreasing the balance due on your sales invoice by the amount of the purchase invoice.</p>

<p>It makes no difference whether the sales or purchase invoice is larger; the procedure is identical. To make an offsetting contra entry, go to the <kbd>Journal Entries</kbd> tab and click <kbd>New Journal Entry</kbd>:</p>

<p>In your journal entry, <strong>debit <em>Accounts payable</em></strong> and the purchase invoice by the smaller of the sales or purchase invoice balances. <strong>Credit <em>Accounts receivable</em></strong> and the sales invoice by the same amount:</p>
<p><img src="https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business2/uploads/manager1/original/2X/e/eb9e0bc1c3a3037040181ccef02d6b390c003ccd.png" alt="" width="686" height="141"></p>
<p>Click <kbd>Create</kbd> to save the journal entry.</p>
<p>If there are more invoices, do not select invoice numbers. Instead, enter as the contra amount the smaller of the total <em>Accounts payable</em> or <em>Accounts receivable</em> balances. Manager will automatically offset outstanding sales and purchase invoices on a first-in-first-settled basis. But still debit <em>Accounts payalbe</em> and credit <em>Accounts receivable</em>.</p>
<table style="background-color: #F6FFF2; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px"><tr><td style="font-size: 48px; opacity: 0.25; padding: 20px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; vertical-align: top"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i></td><td style="padding: 20px">
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
After making the journal entry illustrated above, your purchase invoice will be marked as paid in full, even though your payment was actually via contra entry:<br>

<br>The balance due on the sales invoice will decrease by 200:<br>
