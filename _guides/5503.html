<p><strong>Billable expenses</strong> are expenses incurred on behalf of a customer. They do not appear on your Profit and Loss Statement, because they are not expenses of your business. Instead, they will reside temporarily on your Balance Sheet and be passed through to the customer by invoicing.</p>

<h3>Enable the <kbd>Billable Expenses</kbd> tab</h3>

<p>Enable the <kbd>Billable Expenses</kbd> tab by clicking <kbd>Customize</kbd> below the left navigation pane, ticking the <kbd>Billable Expenses</kbd> box, and clicking <kbd>Update</kbd> below the list:</p>

<h3>Changes to your chart of accounts</h3>

<p>When you enable the <kbd>Billable Expense</kbd> tab, Manager automatically adds three new accounts to your chart of accounts:</p>

<p>These accounts can be renamed under <kbd>Settings</kbd> <strong>=&gt;</strong> <kbd>Chart of Accounts</kbd>, but cannot be deleted while the tab is in use. You can assign them to Groups of your choosing and give them numerical <code>Codes</code> to control their positions on your Balance Sheet or Profit and Loss Statement.</p>

<h3>Record a billable expense</h3>

<p>Unlike most entries in Manager, you cannot record billable expenses directly under the <kbd>Billable Expenses</kbd> tab using a <kbd>New Billable Expense</kbd> button. Instead, billable expenses are recorded in one of these tabs:</p>

<ul>
<li><kbd>Cash Accounts</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>Expense Claims</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>Purchase Invoices</kbd></li>
</ul>

<p>To enter a billable expense, post the applicable line item to the <em>Billable expenses</em> asset account, then select the customer to be billed later:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong><br>A customer must be defined under the <kbd><a href="https://forum.manager.io/t/enter-customers/7018">Customers</a></kbd> tab before a billable expense can be entered on its behalf.</p></blockquote>

<p>Any payment, claim, or invoice line item categorized this way will appear as a disbursement under the <kbd>Billable Expenses</kbd> tab:</p>

<p>Any expense categorized this way will appear on the Balance Sheet in the <em>Billable expenses</em> asset account instead of inflating your expenses:</p>

<p>The amounts under <em>Billable expenses</em> can be cleared by two methods:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://forum.manager.io/t/invoice-billable-expenses/9652">Invoicing billable expenses</a> to the customer</li>
<li><a href="https://forum.manager.io/t/write-off-billable-expenses/9651">Writing off billable expenses</a></li>
</ul>
