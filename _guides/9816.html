<p>Transactions in Manager can be supported and documented with digital attachments. These can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Word processing documents</li>
<li>Spreadsheets</li>
<li>Scanned invoices</li>
<li>Scanned receipts</li>
</ul>
<p>Normally, the attachment is made to the specific transaction to which it relates. But sometimes, attachments do not apply to individual transactions, but to entire projects or accounting periods. In these cases, <strong>organize attachments with folders</strong>.</p>
<h3>Create a folder</h3>
<p>Below the left navigation pane, click <kbd>Customize</kbd>. Check the box for the <kbd>Folders</kbd> tab, then click <kbd>Update</kbd>:</p>

<p>In the <kbd>Folders</kbd> tab, click <kbd>New Folder</kbd>:</p>

<h3>Add an attachment</h3>
<p>Click <kbd>View</kbd> to see contents of a particular folder. The folder will display much like any Manager transaction. The display has no accounting function, but provides a way to add, list, and delete attachments consistent with other tabs in the program.</p>
<p>To place an attachment into the folder, click <kbd>New Attachment</kbd> at the bottom of the folder’s page. Navigate to the file you want to attach and select it according to normal procedures for your operating system. In the illustration below, two files have been attached:</p>

<p>Attachments will be incorporated into the business’ data file, not stored separately for independent file management. The attachment will not be deleted from its original location. To view an attachment, click on its name while viewing the folder. To delete an attachment, click <kbd>X</kbd> after its name. Deleting an attachment from a folder only removes it from the business’ accounting database. It does not delete it from wherever else it may be stored.</p>
