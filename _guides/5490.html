<p>By default, account balances are shown for all transactions entered to date in Manager. This is generally what you need when starting a business. But once you have used Manager for more than a single accounting period (<em>e.g.</em>, a financial year), you should customize the reporting period so the Profit and Loss Statement reflects your current accounting period.</p>

<p>Click <kbd>Set Period</kbd> in the <kbd>Summary</kbd> tab:</p>

<p>Select the reporting period for which you prefer to see figures in your <kbd>Summary</kbd>. Entering <em>Today</em> in the <code>Until</code> field produces a display that is always up to date, but other dates can entered by selecting <em>Custom</em>:</p>
