<p>Your customer has requested an invoice from you. What is it? It is basically a list of goods sent or services provided, with a statement of the sum due for these. Basically a bill. For accounting purposes, many customers won't pay until invoice is presented to them.</p>

<p>So let's say you are running a computer repair business. Before you can starting issuing invoices to customers, you need to set up yourself as a business in Manager.</p>

<h3>Create a business</h3>

<p>Click <kbd>Add Business</kbd> button then <kbd>Create New Business</kbd>, enter your business name and click <kbd>Add Business</kbd></p>

<p>Your business should be created but it will look empty.</p>

<h3>Customizing left navigation</h3>

<p>Since every business is different, all modules will be disabled by default. To issue invoice to customer, we will need to enable <em>Customers</em> and <em>Sales Invoices</em> tabs.</p>

<p>Click <kbd>Customize</kbd> and enable these two tabs so they are added to your left navigation.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/b/be06ea0e0acb9f54191706447373e0ac62cf224f.png" width="410" height="343"></p>

<p>Make sure to click <kbd>Update</kbd> button at the bottom to save your choice.</p>

<p>Now we are getting somewhere, your left navigation will contain two new tabs: <em>Customers</em> and <em>Sales Invoices</em>.</p>

<h3>Adding a customer</h3>

<p>Before you can issue your first invoice, you need to add at least one customer.</p>

<p>Click on <kbd>Customers</kbd> tab.</p>

<p>Then click <kbd>New Customer</kbd> button.</p>

<p>And then click <kbd>Create</kbd> button to save the customer.</p>

<p>Your customer is now created as you can see in the list of customers.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/8/8dce54f01c4bf916aa7c3b2e7ccc58a561876cad.png" width="452" height="162"></p>

<p>Now you are ready to issue an invoice to this customer.</p>

<h3>Issuing an invoice to customer</h3>

<p>Click <kbd>Sales Invoices</kbd> tab.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/2/2bbacac318a16fed67b653c848acb055133cecbd.png" width="199" height="54"></p>

<p>Then click <kbd>New Sales Invoice</kbd> button.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/8/858121e57eca41ebb4af0e42c8d2019563561050.png" width="292" height="70"></p>

<p>This will open new sales invoice form where you need to fill in at least three fields:</p>

<ul>
<li>Customer</li>
<li>Description</li>
<li>Unit Price</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/c/c332f1edce67b269f6c9a985ffe39cd36ef94241.png"></p>

<p>Click <kbd>Create</kbd> button to save the invoice.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/3/34b931a999bb2632adec1dee3e56b6ff71eb77e6.png" width="171" height="83"></p>

<p>You will be instantly taken to preview of your invoice.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/c/cd6af933ff04087fd77f0078eda2f65980f79540.png"></p>

<p>A few notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<em>Unit price</em> doesn't show because you didn't enter any <em>Qty</em>. Manager will always try to make the invoice as simple as possible. If you are not using <em>Qty</em> column, Manager won't show <em>Qty</em> and <em>Unit Price</em> columns on invoice. It will show <em>Amount</em> column only.</li>
<li>By default, your business address will be fictional. You should click on <kbd>Settings</kbd>, then <kbd>Business Details</kbd> to provide your real business address so it will be shown on the invoice.</li>
<li>If you are charging tax such as GST, VAT, sales tax or similar, you need to go to <kbd>Settings</kbd> tab, then <kbd>Tax Codes</kbd> to create relevant tax codes. Then <kbd>Edit</kbd> this invoice to select the right tax code.</li>
<li>If you want to show on invoice payment information, you can put them into <em>Notes</em> field when editing the invoice.</li>
<li>If you would like to show your business logo, go to <kbd>Settings</kbd>, then <kbd>Business Logo</kbd>
</li>
</ul>

<p>When viewing the invoice, also notice <kbd>Switch Theme</kbd> button in top-right corner.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/5/5e049a187154a7873e424653b43d5fe38797c5a2.png" width="147" height="69"></p>

<p>This will allow you change the appearance of your invoice.</p>

<p>After providing your real business address, setting up tax codes, changing the theme, your invoice could look like this:</p>

<p>Then use <kbd>Email</kbd> button to email the invoice to your customer or use <kbd>PDF</kbd> button to generate PDF.</p>
