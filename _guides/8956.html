<p><strong>Tracking codes</strong> are optional. You can apply them to income and expense line items. They were originally intended to support monitoring profitability by division within a single financial entity. But Manager users also find them helpful for monitoring financial performance on major projects, at different geographic locations, or on business brought in by individual sales representatives. You can employ tracking codes selectively. That is, you can apply them only to certain types of transactions or those you want to include in a specific analysis. Different tracking codes can be applied for different purposes, as well.</p>

<table style="background-color: #F6FFF2; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px"><tr><td style="font-size: 48px; opacity: 0.25; padding: 20px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; vertical-align: top"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i></td><td style="padding: 20px"><p><strong>Example 1</strong><br>Brilliant Industries wants to monitor profitability of its incandescent and LED lamp manufacturing divisions. It sets up two tracking codes: <em>INC</em> and <em>LED</em>. All income and expenses are designated with one code or the other. At the end of each financial period, Profit and Loss Statements are generated separately for the two divisions. Combined Profit and Loss Statements can also be created comparing performance of the two divisions.<br><br><br><strong>Example 2</strong><br>Atlas Construction assigns tracking codes to each building project by year: <em>2016-1</em>, <em>2016-2</em>, <em>2017-1</em>, etc. Transactions related to a single project are tagged with appropriate tracking codes. Those pertaining to the business in general are left uncoded. Profit and Loss Statements can be generated for individual projects or the entire company. If necessary, Atlas could designate separate lists of expenses and accounts on which tracking codes would be used for distinct project types. Concrete projects might have tracking codes applied on subcontractor labor, while internally performed electrical projects might have tracking codes applied on wages.</p></td></tr></table>

<h3>Applying tracking codes to transactions</h3>

<p>The same applies to expenses. If an expense should be spread across multiple divisions, you can split the expense to allocate the appropriate amount to each division.</p>
