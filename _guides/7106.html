{% raw %}
<p><strong><em>Suspense</em></strong> is a built-in account where Manager posts transactions it cannot properly resolve. <em>Suspense</em> has several unique characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can neither be created nor deleted by a user.</li>
<li>It appears automatically on the Balance Sheet in the Equity grouping whenever it has a non-zero balance.</li>
<li>It it not listed in the Chart of Accounts under <kbd>Settings</kbd>, so it cannot be edited or moved to a different account group.</li>
<li>Many transaction fields in Manager default to <em>Suspense</em> until valid entries are made in them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any balance in <em>Suspense</em> signals a problem. <strong>Never attempt to clear the <em>Suspense</em> account with a journal entry.</strong> That only hides problems and usually makes both your Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss Statement inaccurate. Problems that caused transactions to post to <em>Suspense</em> <strong>must</strong> be identified and corrected.</p>
<h3>Finding problems in <em>Suspense</em>
</h3>
<p>To identify transactions with problems, drill down by clicking on the blue balance for the <em>Suspense</em> account on the <kbd>Summary</kbd> page:</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/manager1/original/2X/9/90cb8d4ef184043e2a98e330b7f9be9d53a5c348.png" width="508" height="194"></p>
<p>All transactions contributing to the balance will appear. These might be either debits or credits:</p>

<p>If the <kbd>Edit</kbd> button for any transaction is dimmed, be sure Manager is set for accrual basis accounting. Return to the <kbd>Summary</kbd> page and click <kbd>Set Period</kbd>:</p>

<p>Select <kbd>Accrual basis</kbd> in the dropdown box and click <kbd>Update</kbd>:</p>

<p>Then drill down again on the <em>Suspense</em> balance. (You can return to cash basis accounting after problems with <em>Suspense</em> have been cleared.)</p>
<h3>Fixing problems in <em>Suspense</em>
</h3>
<p>The <em>Suspense</em> account above reveals five transactions with some type of error. Each problem must be addressed individually. To fix one, click on the <kbd>Edit</kbd> button to the left of the transaction.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 1: Unassigned expense claim</strong></p>
<p>Beginning with the most recent transaction in the example, an expense claim did not include a Payer:</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/manager1/original/2X/e/eedc47bcbfc390df931e9159345a122e9f435e5b.png" width="690" height="310"></p>
<p>Designating a <a href="/guides/6898">Payer from predefined choices</a> clears this transaction from <em>Suspense</em>:</p>

<p>Remember to click the <kbd>Update</kbd> button to save each correction.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 2: Cash payment not complete</strong></p>
<p>A cash payment for messenger services recorded the recipient, a description, number of deliveries, and price, but did not include proper allocation to an expense account:</p>

<p>Selection of the appropriate account correctly completes the transaction:</p>

<p><strong>Problem 3: Capital contribution not properly allocated</strong></p>
<p>The next transaction recorded a contribution of capital from a partner to fund a remodeling project, but neglected to designate that the receipt was directed to a capital account, which partnerâ€™s account, or which subaccount:</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/manager1/original/2X/5/57f233787ea9315b1bd65ea9bbffe43457c44db5.png" width="690" height="287"></p>
<p>Adding those details to the receipt fixes the problem:</p>

<p><strong>Problem 4: Unbalanced journal entry</strong></p>
<p>A journal entry contained a typographical error, reversing digits when recording a distribution of earnings. This mistake resulted in an unbalanced transaction:</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/manager1/original/2X/0/024447f81c513e88b077b4d32e6c7ab30aab6457.png" width="690" height="221"></p>
<p>Editing the mistake properly balances the transaction, removing it from <em>Suspense</em>:</p>

<p><strong>Problem 5: Fixed asset purchase invoice</strong></p>
<p>The final problem in the example is a purchase invoice for a delivery truck that did not properly assign the purchase to the <em>Fixed assets</em> account and the specific asset created for the truck:</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/manager1/original/2X/7/757b071cbf7dfa39e1f4e7ae4ba03eea46f6571a.png" width="690" height="233"></p>
<p>The corrected purchase invoice resolves the problem:</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/manager1/original/2X/f/f0bd91e9fdff6fa06efbedfe40820e0d625c10b0.png" width="690" height="49"></p>
<p><em>Suspense</em> is now empty and no longer shows on the Balance Sheet:</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/manager1/original/2X/0/09063001c0882738046266c52e5c4b783a588734.png" width="552" height="166"></p>
<p>Manager is designed to preserve information rather than reject incorrect entries. But when anything is in your <em>Suspense</em> account, your records and reports are almost certainly wrong.</p>
