<p>When a customer purchases items  on a regular basis, instead of creating a new sales invoice from scratch for every purchase, it may be convenient to use the <kbd>Clone</kbd> button to replicate a previous invoice:</p>

<p>When cloning an existing sales invoice,  everything is cloned into the new invoice, including quantity, unit price and discount:</p>

<p>This may not be completely desirable if your prices have changed since you issued the prior invoice. But there is a quick way to remedy the problem. If you need to refresh the unit price of an inventory or non-inventory item, click the <kbd><strong>X</strong></kbd> inside the <code>Item</code> field to clear it. Then select the same item again:</p>

<p>This refreshes the <code>Unit price</code> field to the current sale price. <code>Qty</code> and <code>Discount</code> fields will not change:</p>

<p>As always, any aspect of the new invoice can be edited before clicking <kbd>Create</kbd>. And the same procedure works when editing an invoice that has already been created.</p>
