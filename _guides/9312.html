<p>The <strong><code>Code</code></strong> field for suppliers is completely optional. It can be used for several purposes, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Distinguishing suppliers with identical names</li>
<li>Annotating different departments or ordering centers at a single supplier (with each department being created as a distinct supplier)</li>
<li>Assigning suppliers to regions, purchasing personnel, or facilities</li>
</ul>

<h3>Assign a supplier code</h3>

<p>When creating or editing a supplier in the <kbd>Suppliers</kbd> tab, enter any combination of letters or numbers in the <code>Code</code> field:</p>

<p>By default, the supplier's code will be shown on printed documents next to supplier's name:</p>

<p>The code will also show in the <kbd>Suppliers</kbd> listing and can be entered as a search parameter in other tabs:</p>

<h3>Removing the supplier code from documents</h3>

<p>If you wish to remove the supplier code from completed forms, edit the theme used to display them. While viewing the theme's computer code, find the line using the variable <code>{{ recipient.code }}</code>. This is a placeholder variable that inserts the supplier code into your documents. To hide the supplier code, simply remove <code>{{ recipient.code }}</code> from your theme. <strong>Leave the rest of the line it was in unchanged.</strong></p>

<p>After you save your new or modified theme, the supplier code will no longer show.</p>
