<p><strong>Purchase invoices</strong> are the method by which sales invoices received from suppliers are entered into Manager. They increase the balance of the supplier's subaccount in <em>Accounts payable</em> and, therefore, are used when buying on credit. They can also be used to maintain a record of transactions with a supplier. They do not, however, record payment of money, which must be handled by a second transaction, even if the supplier is paid upon delivery. In a double-entry accounting system like Manager, they also post expenses to appropriate accounts and record additions to inventory.</p>

<h3>Enable the <kbd>Purchase Invoices</kbd> tab</h3>

<p>To enable the <kbd>Purchase Invoices</kbd> tab, click <kbd>Customize</kbd> below the left navigation pane, check the box for <kbd>Purchase Invoices</kbd>, and click <kbd>Update</kbd> below the list:</p>

<p>Manager offers six methods for creating purchase invoices:</p>

<ul>
<li>Standard method (from suppliers' sales invoices)</li>
<li>By cloning</li>
<li>From purchase orders</li>
<li>From a sales quotes</li>
<li>From sales orders</li>
<li>From your own sales invoices</li>
</ul>

<h3>Standard method</h3>

<p>In the <kbd>Purchase Invoices</kbd> tab, click on <kbd>New Purchase Invoice</kbd>:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/5/53c41e6f87b7ed21f268be6f3bef73796a06266d.png" width="223" height="52"> <strong><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right" style="margin-right: 10px; color: #999; font-size: 18px; padding-top: 5px"></i></strong> <img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/c/cdf21fee56c28403b5de6330e215820304cc1f05.png" width="308" height="52"></p>

<p>The first stage of the purchase invoice entry screen appears:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/d/da90f3bad7bff0f6082792117f5f088c9b561fdf.png" width="527" height="320"></p>

<p>By default, the <code>Invoice date</code> field is repopulated with today's date. A <code>Due date</code> can be entered from the supplier's invoice. The order number field can be used to record your own purchase order number, if you issued one. A <a href="/guides/7020">previously defined <code>Supplier</code></a> must be selected in the dropdown box before proceeding.</p>

<p>Line items can be completed semi-automatically by selecting predefined inventory or non-inventory items and entering quantities. Or, they may be entered manually. Applicable tax codes can be selected. Additional lines can be added 1, 5, 10, or 20 at a time. </p>

<p>A checkbox allows you to indicate whether a discount was applied. When checked, further options of percentage or fixed amount discounts appear:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/c/c6d82dbaafe9e1601283a542622fd621b55ee0d9.png" width="250" height="84"></p>

<p>Note the option to indicate prices are tax inclusive. If this box is checked, tax amounts are deducted from the unit price; otherwise they are added:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/e/e835ee5a241d197c6cc3f4e5021f3bb884cfbb21.png" width="180" height="32"></p>

<p>Click <kbd>Create</kbd> to generate the finished purchase invoice. (Note that in the illustration below, no discount has been applied.):</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/6/6f2eb096b3348d306f4a857d2d19820a374a6eb1.png"></p>

<p>The transaction is now listed in the <kbd>Purchase Invoices</kbd> tab:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/5/5dd5d12be8cb1496c8f6ddb8fa857b4a99bb7991.png"></p>

<p>It can also be located by drilling down in the <kbd>Suppliers</kbd> tab and clicking on the number of invoices for a particular supplier:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/2/272d6e5e02e3cd4e7083855706f8702afa0729fc.png" width="219" height="50"> <strong><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right" style="margin-right: 10px; color: #999; font-size: 18px; padding-top: 5px"></i></strong></p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/0/0c8dfde18531f6ca68404939d8c5d6f3c30d3f9d.png" width="592" height="46"></p>

<h3>By cloning</h3>

<p>For a repeat purchase, an existing purchase invoice can be duplicated by cloning. While viewing the existing purchase invoice, click <kbd>Clone</kbd>:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/2/204403d81176a42575e3142117c3c06fc2fe9a56.png" width="521" height="153"></p>

<h3>From purchase orders</h3>

<p>If a purchase order was issued from Manager and the supplier's sales invoice matches it, a corresponding purchase invoice can be created directly from the existing purchase order. This eliminates the need to enter information a second time. While viewing the purchase order, select <em>New Purchase Invoice</em> in the <kbd>Copy to...</kbd> dropdown box:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/b/b469c15f5e5c9e26d2b7709fcdc4ff5f7f80f213.png"></p>

<p>The resulting purchase invoice can be edited, if necessary, in case of differences from the purchase order.</p>

<h3>From sales quotes</h3>

<p>If a customer was given a sales quote for items that now have been provided by a supplier, the supplier's sales invoice may closely match the sales quote. A purchase invoice can be created directly from the sales quote without re-entering information. When viewing the sales quote, select <em>New Purchase Invoice</em> from the <kbd>Copy to...</kbd> dropdown box:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/b/b0f3e8f5cfd62bece9956e72c02300ea715fa3df.png"></p>

<p>A purchase invoice entry screen appears. After the actual supplier is selected, a purchase invoice is created, carrying forward relevant information.</p>

<h3>From sales orders</h3>

<p>If an internal sales order was created in response to a customer's order, but items to fulfill it were purchased from outside suppliers, a purchase invoice representing the supplier's sales invoice can be created directly from the sales order. This is useful when no purchase order was created in Manager. (If one was, create the purchase invoice from the purchase order, as described above.)</p>

<p>Exactly as when creating a purchase invoice from a sales quote, select <em>New Purchase Invoice</em> from the <kbd>Copy to...</kbd> dropdown box:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/8/87b77a5f3e1b265fdf89ebe7f6e864e19d9cf88b.png" width="512" height="165"></p>

<h3>From your own sales invoices</h3>

<p>A final method for creating a purchase invoice is from your own customer sales invoice. This option might be useful when a business keeps records of goods and services from a supplier and does not require a sales invoice from the supplier. Instead, the business assumes it must pay its supplier for what it has invoiced its customer.</p>

<p>Again, select <em>New Purchase Invoice</em> from the <kbd>Copy to...</kbd> dropdown box on the sales invoice:</p>
