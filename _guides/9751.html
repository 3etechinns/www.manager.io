<p><strong>Employees</strong> in Manager are persons for whom the business will record payroll transactions. Individuals must be set up as employees before payslips can be issued to them. Employees are also eligible to submit expense claims, even if they are not specifically defined as expense claims payers and do not have a capital account. (See <a href="https://forum.manager.io/t/use-expense-claims/6898">another Guide</a> for more information about expense claims.)</p>

<p>Local laws usually govern who is considered an employee. Even when a regular amount is paid to them, some individuals might need to be treated as partners (with capital accounts), sole traders/proprietors (with equity accounts), or subcontractors. The key factor in deciding to enter a person as an employee is usually whether their compensation can be considered a wage expense under local law and accounting regulations.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong><br>Some businesses use third-party processing services to manage payroll. In such cases, there is usually no reason to enable the <kbd>Employees</kbd> tab, because individual payroll transactions are not entered in Manager. Instead, lump-sum transactions are entered for each payroll period and individual payroll records are maintained by the outside processor. This can be advantageous when local tax and retirement laws are complex or change frequently.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Enable the <kbd>Employees</kbd> tab</h3>

<p>Before an employee can be entered, enable the <kbd>Employees</kbd> tab. Below the left navigation pane, click <kbd>Customize</kbd>. Check the box for <kbd>Employees</kbd>, and click <kbd>Update</kbd> below the list:</p>

<h3>Chart of accounts additions</h3>

<p>Three accounts are activated automatically when the <kbd>Employees</kbd> tab is enabled:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<em>Employee clearing account</em>, a liability account recording amounts owed to (and by) employees in individual subaccounts</li>
<li>
<em>Payroll liabilities</em>, recording obligations of the business to pay deductions or contributions to outside entities</li>
<li>
<em>Wages &amp; salaries</em>, a default expense account where costs of employees are recorded</li>
</ul>

<p>These accounts can be renamed but not deleted while the <kbd>Employees</kbd> tab is enabled. Rename them by editing under <kbd>Settings</kbd> =&gt; <kbd>Chart of Accounts</kbd>.</p>

<h3>Enter an employee</h3>
