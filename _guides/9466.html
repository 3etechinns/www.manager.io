<p>Old, inactive Suppliers can clog your lists. You can delete them if you have never entered any type of transaction for them. <kbd>Edit</kbd> the Supplier and click <kbd>Delete</kbd> at the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p>But if you have entered any transactions, Manager will not allow you to delete a Supplier, because doing so would also delete all related transactions. Instead, you can make a Supplier inactive. <kbd>Edit</kbd> the Supplier and check the <code>Inactive</code> box. Click <kbd>Update</kbd> and the Supplier will no longer appear in lists:</p>

<p>If the Supplier ever returns to active status, click <kbd>Show inactive</kbd> at the lower left corner of the <kbd>Suppliers</kbd> list:</p>

<p><kbd>Edit</kbd> the particular Supplier by unchecking the <code>Inactive</code> box. Other inactive Suppliers will not be affected.</p>
