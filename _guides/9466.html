<p>Old, inactive Suppliers can clog your lists. You can delete them if you have never entered any type of transaction for them. <kbd>Edit</kbd> the Supplier and click <kbd>Delete</kbd> at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>But if you have entered any transactions, Manager will not allow you to delete a Supplier, because doing so would also delete all related transactions. Instead, you can make a Supplier inactive. <kbd>Edit</kbd> the Supplier and check the <code>Inactive</code> box. Click <kbd>Update</kbd> and the Supplier will no longer appear in active lists:</p>

<p>If the Supplier ever returns to active status, scroll to the bottom of the suppliers list, where you will see the Supplier’s name in light grey text with strike-through markings. Click <kbd>Edit</kbd> next to the Supplier’s name:</p>
