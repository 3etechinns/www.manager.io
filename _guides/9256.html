<p><strong>Custom control accounts</strong> can be useful additions to your chart of accounts. A control account in Manager is a top-level, balance sheet account containing subsidiary ledgers or subaccounts. (The terms are interchangeable). Some accounts activated automatically when various tabs are enabled are control accounts. Perhaps the most familiar example is <em>Cash &amp; cash equivalents</em>, the default control account for cash accounts. Another good example is <em>Accounts receivable</em>, made up of individual customer ledgers.</p>

<p>A custom control account is one you create yourself to segregate and give visibility to selected subsidiary ledgers that would otherwise be assigned to a built-in control account. A custom control account may contain only one type of subsidiary ledger, but all the same possibilities as for built-in control accounts are allowed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cash accounts</li>
<li>Customers</li>
<li>Suppliers</li>
<li>Inventory items</li>
<li>Fixed assets</li>
<li>Intangible assets</li>
</ul>

He wants see the value of these important assets on his balance sheet separately from other fixed assets like workbenches and office furniture. So he creates a custom control account called <em>Digital machinery</em> and assigns those fixed assets to it.<br><br>Northwind Traders has a variety of cash accounts it uses for different purposes. Rather than leave them all lumped together under the built-in control account, <em>Cash &amp; cash equivalents</em>, it decides to break them apart for better management visibility. So the company renames that account as <em>Cash deposits</em>. It creates two new custom control accounts, <em>Payroll accounts</em> and <em>Term deposits</em>. Northwind leaves its various demand deposit and petty cash funds in the original, renamed account. It assigns the accounts at local branch banks used to pay employees in various cities to <em>Payroll accounts</em>. And it assigns its longer term certificates of deposit to <em>Term deposits</em>. Now the balance sheet clearly distinguishes between highly liquid funds, money available for the weekly payroll, and cash reserves that are not readily accessible.</p></td></tr></table>

It has not defined any tax codes. Nor has it set a start date. By default, the purchase costs of all fixed assets are shown on the balance sheet under the <em>Fixed assets</em> account (a built-in control account). The company wants to split fixed assets into categories and have each category show separately as:<br><br>- <em>Land &amp; Buildings</em><br>- <em>Motor Vehicles</em><br>- <em>Furniture</em><br><br>To do this, the company creates a custom control account made up of fixed assets:<br><br><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/f/f3c0c2d181b71f6caf6fdc3608da4f0e568b2fd5.png" width="541" height="213"><br><br>It creates another custom control account named <em>Motor Vehicles</em>. And it renames <em>Fixed assets</em> as <em>Furniture</em>.

<p>Once you have created a custom control account made up of a specific subaccount type, you will be able to select control accounts for all subaccounts of the same type when creating new ones or by editing existing ones.</p>
