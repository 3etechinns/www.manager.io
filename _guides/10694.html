<p>In order to regain access, you will need to reset <code>administrator</code> password.</p>

<p>The password is saved in application data folder where Manager stores all data. In order to reset the password, go to application data folder.</p>

<p>Find the file named <code>password</code> and delete it. This will remove password from <code>administrator</code> account.</p>

<p>You can go back to login screen and enter username <code>administrator</code> and click <code>Login</code> button (do not enter anything into password field).</p>

<p>It is highly recommended, once you log in, you set new password under <code>Users</code> tab so nobody will be able to gain access to your server as <code>administrator</code> without entering any password.</p>
