<p>Old, inactive Customers can clog your lists. You can delete them if you have never entered any type of transaction for them. <kbd>Edit</kbd> the Customer and click <kbd>Delete</kbd> at the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p>But if you have entered any transactions, Manager will not allow you to delete a Customer, because doing so would also delete all related, historical transactions. Instead, you can make a Customer inactive. <kbd>Edit</kbd> the Customer and check the <code>Inactive</code> box. Click <kbd>Update</kbd>, and the Customer will no longer appear in lists.</p>

<p>If the Customer ever returns to active status, click <kbd>Show inactive</kbd> at the lower left corner of the <kbd>Customers</kbd> list.</p>
