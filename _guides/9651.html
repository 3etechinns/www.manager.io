<p>If your customer refuses to reimburse you for a billable expense or you cannot invoice it for any reason, you will need to write it off. To write off a billable expense, go to the <kbd>Billable expenses</kbd> tab:</p>

<p>Change <code>Status</code> from <em>Uninvoiced</em> to <em>Written-off</em>, then enter the date the billable expense should be written off:</p>

<p>Click the <kbd>Update</kbd> button:</p>

<p>You must enter the write-off date because, from an accounting point of view, the billable expense was recoverable from the date it was incurred until you decided it should be written-off. Therefore, it was not truly an expense of your business, but of your customerâ€™s. When it is written-off, it becomes your expense. The amount will be transferred from the <em>Billable expenses</em> asset account to the <em>Billable expenses - unrecoverable</em> expense account.</p>
