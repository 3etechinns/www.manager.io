<p><strong>Adding a business</strong> to Manager is simple. After you have downloaded, installed, and launched the program on your computer or accessed it via a web browser, go to the <kbd>Businesses</kbd> tab, click <kbd>Add Business</kbd>, and select <em>Create New Business</em> in the dropdown box:</p>

<p>A <kbd>Summary</kbd> page for your added business will appear. Four universal tabs will be activated, because all businesses need them:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Caution</strong><br>Manager will not prevent adding or importing businesses with identical names. To avoid confusion, such as when renaming and restoring a backup file by eliminating the date stamp, consider removing other businesses with the same name from the <kbd>Businesses</kbd> tab first. (See instructions in <a href="https://forum.manager.io/t/remove-a-business/9123">another guide</a>.)</p></blockquote>
