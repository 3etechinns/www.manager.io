<p>Transactions in Manager can be substantiated and documented with digital attachments. These can include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Word processing documents</li>
<li>Spreadsheets</li>
<li>Scanned invoices</li>
<li>Scanned receipts</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong><br>Normally, an attachment is made to the specific transaction to which it relates. When attachments do not apply to individual transactions, but, for example, to entire projects or accounting periods, they can be organized in folders. See <a href="https://forum.manager.io/t/organize-attachments-with-folders/9816">another Guide</a> for instructions.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Add an attachment</h3>

<p>Click <kbd>View</kbd> to see any transaction form in Manager. To add an attachment to the transaction, click <kbd>New Attachment</kbd> at the bottom of the page. Navigate to the file you want to attach and select it according to normal procedures for your operating system. In the illustration below, a spreadsheet file has been attached to a sales quote:</p>

<h3>Managing attachments</h3>

<p>Attachments will be incorporated into the business' data file, not stored separately for independent file management. The attachment will not be deleted from its original location.</p>

<p>To view an attachment, click on its name while viewing the transaction. To delete an attachment, click <kbd>X</kbd> after its name. Deleting an attachment from a transaction only removes it from the business' accounting database. It does not delete it from wherever else it may be stored.</p>
