<p><strong>Customer deposits and advances</strong> are funds received by a business from a customer before they have been earned. While the funds may be present in a bank or cash account of the business, they are actually being held in trust for the customer and represent a liability the business must eventually either repay or convert to income by completion of the economic activity for which they are intended. Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deposits accompanying purchase orders for custom manufacturing</li>
<li>Receipts from prepayments for services or utilities to be invoiced later to the customer</li>
<li>Deposits received for confirmation of hotel reservations</li>
<li>Cleaning or damage deposits for rental property received from tenants</li>
</ul>
<h3>Accounting for deposits and advances</h3>
<p>Two  essential facts must be recorded for every deposit or advance:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Customer</strong> - who is making the deposit?</li>
<li>
<strong>Amount</strong> - how much is the deposit?</li>
</ul>
<p>In Manager, both facts are recorded simultaneously when the deposit or advance is received. To receive a deposit, go to the <kbd>Bank Accounts</kbd> or <kbd>Cash Accounts</kbd> tab and click on <kbd>Receive money</kbd>:</p>

<p>The first stage of a receipt entry form will appear. Edit the <strong><code>Date</code></strong>, if necessary. Add a <strong><code>Reference</code></strong>, if desired. Select the bank or cash account where the deposit will be lodged. You cannot proceed without selecting an account. In the illustration below, the <em>Checking account</em> is selected:</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.manager.io/uploads/manager1/original/2X/9/9c5c651f64bd5540b94a528d468bdaf300722893.png" alt="38 PM" width="339" height="316"></p>
<p>Complete the receipt. Do not select anything in the <code>Item</code> field. Select <em>Accounts receivable</em> and the customer’s subaccount. <strong>Leave the <code>Invoice</code> field blank.</strong> A quantity is not required, because no inventory items or billable items are involved with a deposit. You may simply enter the total deposit in the <code>Unit price</code> field. However, if you wish, enter the quantity and unit price and Manager will calculate a total amount:</p>

<p>Click <kbd>Create</kbd> to finish.</p>
<table style="background-color: #F2F9FF; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px"><tr><td style="font-size: 48px; opacity: 0.25; padding: 20px; padding-top: 15px; padding-right: 0px; vertical-align: top"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></td><td style="padding: 20px">
<p><strong>Note</strong><br>
Deposits, even those involving calculations with quantities and unit prices, have no impact on inventory values or quantities because no inventory item is designated.</p>

<h3>Using deposits and advances</h3>
<p>The receipt will now be added to the applicable bank or cash account’s balance. If marked as pending, it will show in the <code>Pending deposits</code> column:</p>

<p>The deposit also reduces the total <em>Accounts receivable</em> balance, though the effect of a specific deposit may be obscured on the Balance Sheet if there are other deposits from any customers:</p>

<p>To view specific information about customer deposits, you must first drill down by clicking the <em>Accounts receivable</em> balance and locating the customer’s account <code>Balance</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.manager.io/uploads/manager1/original/2X/5/5a28344fb1c3280dd7e014723222fa0eee743c7c.png" alt="58 PM" width="690" height="273"></p>
<p>Clicking on the balance, you can see transactions contributing to it, including the recent deposit:</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.manager.io/uploads/manager1/original/2X/6/68a80e0ae49cc8e09005250e9d9661c102fbf092.png" alt="39 PM" width="685" height="271"></p>
<p>You can do the same thing in the <kbd>Customers</kbd> tab, with identical results.</p>
<p>Whenever a sales invoice is created for a customer, any available net credit in that customer’s <em>Accounts receivable</em> balance will be automatically applied, reducing the balance due on the new sales invoice.</p>
<table style="background-color: #F2F9FF; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px"><tr><td style="font-size: 48px; opacity: 0.25; padding: 20px; padding-top: 15px; padding-right: 0px; vertical-align: top"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></td><td style="padding: 20px">
<p><strong>Note</strong><br>
Deposits and advances cannot be applied on sales recorded only via cash receipts. Such transactions are not processed through <em>Accounts receivable</em>, so Manager cannot apply any available balance. If you sell to a customer on a cash-and-carry basis, but wish to apply an existing deposit or advance, you must create and receive money against a sales invoice in separate transactions.</p>
