<p>In Manager, closing an accounting period is not required, but a <strong>lock date</strong> can be set to prevent any changes on or before a desired date.</p>

<p>Go to the <kbd>Settings</kbd> tab and click <kbd>Lock Date</kbd>:</p>

<p>Enter the desired lock date and click <kbd>Update</kbd>.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Example</strong><br>Maria wants to prevent any changes to accounting transactions before  1 January 2015. She sets the lock date to 31 December 2014:<br><br><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/d/d7cb704cb189bf759eae0c4cb61080b39cb913f0.png" width="246" height="190"><br><br>Now, if she tries to edit or delete any transaction dated on or before 31 December 2014, she will see the following notice:<br><br><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/3/34dd649164e8cb152cea0787c089936b18770812.png" width="651" height="83"></p></blockquote>

<p>You can temporarily remove the lock date if you need to edit or delete a transaction. Enter the lock date again when you have completed the changes to previously locked transactions. </p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong><br><kbd>Lock Date</kbd> is useful in multi-user editions of Manager to prevent restricted users from modifying locked transactions. Ensure the <kbd>Lock Date</kbd> feature is disabled for restricted users to prevent them from unlocking restricted data. For administrators or unrestricted users, the feature will act as a reminder to prevent accidental data modification.</p></blockquote>
