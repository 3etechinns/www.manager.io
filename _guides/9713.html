<p>When migrating to Manager from a prior accounting system, intangible assets must be carried forward at their book values from the previous system. Basic procedures for creating intangible assets in Manager are described in <a href="/guides/9700">another Guide</a>. Read it first.</p>

<p>Migration is easily accomplished in Manager as intangible assets are created. Two pieces of information are required for every intangible asset being carried forward:</p>

<ul>
<li>Initial purchase cost</li>
<li>Total of accumulated amortization at the closing date of the prior accounting system</li>
</ul>

<p>To migrate an existing intangible asset, go to the left navigation pane, click <kbd>Intangible Assets</kbd>, then <kbd>New Intangible Asset</kbd>:</p>

<p>Complete the entry (some fields appear progressively):</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong><code>Name</code></strong> is the name that will appear for the intangible asset in reports and lists.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>Code</code></strong> is an optional alphabetic or numeric designation for the intangible asset. Numeric entries will control the asset's position in lists.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>Description</code></strong> accepts detailed information about the intangible asset.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>Starting balance</code></strong> should be checked. Before you can enter a starting balance, you must set the <kbd>Start Date</kbd> in the <kbd>Settings</kbd> tab.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>Purchase cost</code></strong> is the initial cost of the intangible asset when first acquired.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>Accumulated amortization</code></strong> is the sum of all amortization entered for this intangible asset under the prior accounting system.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>Book value</code></strong> will calculate automatically. It should match the book value on the final day of the prior accounting system.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>Disposed intangible asset</code></strong> should be left blank as you create the intangible asset.</li>
</ul>

<p>Click <kbd>Create</kbd>. The intangible asset will show under the <kbd>Intangible Assets</kbd> tab:</p>

<p>The purchase cost of the intangible asset will be combined with any other intangible assets' costs and displayed under the <em>Assets</em> category on the <kbd>Summary</kbd> page. A contra account, <em>Intangible assets, accumulated amortization</em>, will record amortization to date for all intangible assets. The difference between the two account balances represents current book value of all intangible assets:</p>
