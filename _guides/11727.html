<p>You can <strong>convert a bank or cash account into the other type</strong>, transferring all prior transactions to it along with the account itself. This might be necessary in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>The account was miscategorized when first created prior to version 17.9.0. (All bank and cash accounts were handled under a single <kbd>Cash Accounts</kbd> tab in earlier versions. The only distinction was a checkbox to indicate the account was maintained by a financial institution.)</li>
<li>The account was mistakenly categorized in version 17.9.0 or a later version and has had transactions entered, so it cannot be deleted.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Convert an account</h3>
<p>Select the home tab for the account you want to convert, either <kbd>Bank Accounts</kbd> or <kbd>Cash Accounts</kbd>:</p>

<h3>Results of conversion</h3>
<p>If the tab for the destination account type has not yet been enabled, Manager will enable it. Likewise, if the converted account has transactions associated with it, Manager will enable the transactions tab for the destination account type.</p>
<p>The converted account will appear in the listing for the destination tab. Manager will treat the converted account as though it had always been the new type.</p>
<p>Transactions previously entered in the converted account will now appear under the destination account type’s transactions tab.</p>
<p>Finally, if the converted account is the last of its type, the tab for that type will disappear unless the tab has been separately enabled via the <kbd>Customize</kbd> link.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
Brilliant Industries is beginning operations. It creates one bank account named <em>Main business account</em> in the &lt;Bank Accounts tab. But it mistakenly enters three petty cash transactions into that account. The <kbd>Bank Accounts</kbd> tab shows the single bank account (red circle) and three transactions (blue arrow):<br>

<br>Brilliant realizes its mistake and decides to fix it by converting the bank account to a petty cash fund. When the conversion is complete, everything has been transferred to the <kbd>Cash Accounts</kbd> and <kbd>Cash Transactions</kbd> tabs:<br>

<br>In this case, the <kbd>Bank Accounts</kbd> and <kbd>Bank Transactions</kbd> tabs remain, because they were enabled via <kbd>Customize</kbd>.<br>
<br>Brilliant edits the new cash account to change its name to <em>Petty cash</em>. It creates a new bank account named <em>Main business account</em>. This way, Brilliant avoids having to delete and re-enter transactions or accounts. Results are visible in the two accounts tabs:<br>

<table style="background-color: #ffffdb; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px"><tr><td style="font-size: 48px; opacity: 0.25; padding: 20px; padding-top: 15px; padding-right: 0px; vertical-align: top"><i class="fa fa-warning"></i></td><td style="padding: 20px">
<p><strong>Caution</strong><br>
When bank accounts are converted into cash accounts, status of any pending deposits and withdrawals will be lost, because cash transactions are assumed to clear immediately. An account itself can be reconverted, but pending status will not be restored.<br>
<br>Also, custom fields from the converted account will not carry over, because custom fields are unique to a form type.</p>
