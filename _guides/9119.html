<p><strong>Depreciation</strong> is the portion of a fixed asset's cost recorded as an expense during the current accounting period. In simple terms, since a fixed asset has a useful life longer than one accounting period, depreciation represents the part of its value used up during the current period.</p>

<p>Depreciation can be calculated many ways. Straight-line depreciation is the simplest, dividing the fixed asset's cost by the number of accounting periods it is expected to last. Other methods might yield greater depreciation in early accounting periods or take into account the salvage or scrap value of the fixed asset after it is fully depreciated. Tax regulations might also allow accelerated depreciation to encourage business investment or simplify filing.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong><br>Because so many schemes for depreciation exist, Manager does not calculate depreciation amounts. You must determine allowable depreciation for the current accounting period according to a fixed asset's useful life, original cost, depreciation method, and local regulations. Once you have done that, Manager will keep track of how much depreciation has been accumulated for the fixed asset.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Enter depreciation</h3>

<p>To enter depreciation for a specific fixed asset, go to the <kbd>Fixed Assets</kbd> tab. Click on the blue figure in the <code>Accumulated depreciation</code> column for that asset:</p>

<p>This will transfer you to the depreciation register for the selected fixed asset. Click the <kbd>New Depreciation Entry</kbd> button to enter the depreciation expense amount:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Example</strong><br>Brilliant Industries purchased a packaging machine for 10,500. It has an expected lifetime of 10 years and is being depreciated monthly. Monthly depreciation is calculated:<br><br>10,500 cost / 120 months = 87.50 / month<br><br>This amount is entered on the depreciation entry screen:<br><br><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/c/c747991e4f368a569630f54a0a5edf06460ed029.png" width="448" height="282"><br><br></p></blockquote>

<p>The <kbd>Fixed Assets</kbd> register now shows the depreciation amount and reduced book value:</p>

<p>Subsequent depreciation entries will add to the total of accumulated depreciation. A complete record of depreciation for the asset can be seen by clicking on the blue balance:</p>

<p>The <kbd>Summary</kbd> tab combines accumulated depreciation for all fixed assets. It displays <em>Fixed assets, accumulated depreciation</em> as a contra asset account (meaning the balance is normally negative). This control account is activated automatically when you enable the <kbd>Fixed Assets</kbd> tab:</p>
