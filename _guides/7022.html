<p>A <strong>customer statement</strong> summarizes the position of your customer. By itself, it does not create any obligation for the customer to pay you. That is the purpose of sales invoices. In fact, a customer statement has no direct financial impact on anything. Although some businesses use customer statements for billing, they are really more informational in nature. They can be used for several reasons, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sending reminders of amounts owed</li>
<li>Listing opening balances, receipts, new charges, and closing balances during a billing period</li>
<li>Summarizing aging of <em>Accounts receivable</em> (how long overdue payments might be)</li>
<li>Answering customers’ questions</li>
<li>Troubleshooting account disputes</li>
<li>Reviewing customer history</li>
</ul>
<h3>Creating customer statements</h3>
<p>Customer statements are created in the <kbd>Reports</kbd> tab under <em>Accounts receivable</em>. The reports in this group become available automatically when you <a href="/guides/7018">activate the <kbd>Customers</kbd> tab</a>. Click on <kbd>Customer Statements</kbd>.</p>

<p>Manager can generate two types of customer statements, selectable in a dropdown box:</p>
<p><strong><em>Unpaid invoices</em> statements</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Unpaid invoices</em> option produces a classical customer statement based on sales invoices that have not been completely paid. The default <code>Until</code> date is the current date, but others can be entered.</p>

<p>Click <kbd>Next</kbd> to see a list of customers who owe you money. The list shows numbers of unpaid invoices and <em>Accounts receivable</em> balances:</p>

<p>Click <kbd>View</kbd> to see a specific customer’s statement, which can be printed or emailed:</p>

<p><strong><em>Transactions</em> statements</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Transactions</em> option brings the opportunity to specify both <code>From</code> and <code>Until</code> dates:</p>

<p>Again, clicking <kbd>Next</kbd> shows a list of available statements. Only those customers with transactions during the specified period will show. Click <kbd>View</kbd> to see the desired customer statement:</p>
<p><img src="https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business2/uploads/manager1/original/2X/9/9d3b1201d7e6bb3aa15f41a589c0167f3bb55131.png" width="601" height="481"></p>
<p>This format lists transactions as debits and credits from the customer’s perspective. Thus, invoices are shown as debits and receipts as credits, opposite from their categorization in your own accounts. Running balances are also shown.</p>
<table style="background-color: #F2F9FF; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px"><tr><td style="font-size: 48px; opacity: 0.25; padding: 20px; padding-top: 15px; padding-right: 0px; vertical-align: top"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></td><td style="padding: 20px">
<p><strong>Note</strong><br>
Customer statements do not include any sales made as cash transactions, because these are not processed through the <em>Accounts receivable</em> account and therefore do involve the customer’s subsidiary ledger.</p>
