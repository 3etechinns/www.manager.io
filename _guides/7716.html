<p>The <strong><code>Code</code></strong> field for customers is completely optional. It can be used for several purposes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distinguishing customers with identical names</li>
<li>Annotating different departments or cost centers at a single customer (with each department being created as a distinct customer)</li>
<li>Assigning customers to regions, sales personnel, or routes</li>
</ul>
<h3>Assign a customer code</h3>
<p>When creating or editing a customer in the <kbd>Customers</kbd> tab, enter any combination of letters or numbers in the <code>Code</code> field:</p>

<p>By default, the customer’s code will be shown on printed documents next to customer’s name:</p>

<p>The code will also show in the <kbd>Customers</kbd> listing and can be entered as a search parameter in other tabs:</p>

<h3>Removing the customer code from documents</h3>
<p>If you wish to remove the customer code from completed forms, edit the theme used to display them. While viewing the theme’s computer code, find the line using the variable <code>{{ recipient.code }}</code>. This is a placeholder variable that inserts the customer code into your documents. To hide the customer code, simply remove <code>{{ recipient.code }}</code> from your theme. <strong>Leave the rest of the line it was in unchanged.</strong></p>
<p>After you save your new or modified theme, the customer code will no longer show.</p>
