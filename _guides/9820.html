<p><strong>Journal entries</strong> record accounting transactions  of a business. The terminology refers to the days of hand-written accounting records, when daily transactions were were entered in a journal and later posted to individual account ledgers.</p>

<p>In Manager, most transactions are entered in other functional tabs, thereby automating many decisions about account posting and reducing errors. So journal entries are relatively few; most record transfers between accounts. In fact, no transaction involving the actual receipt or payment of funds by a business can be recorded via a journal entry.</p>

<p>The <kbd>Journal Entries</kbd> tab is always enabled for every business. To make a journal entry, go to that tab and click <kbd>New Journal Entry</kbd>:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong><code>Date</code></strong> is prefilled with today's date, but can be edited.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>Reference</code></strong> is optional. It can be a serial number or other alphanumeric input.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>Narration</code></strong> should be a brief description of the overall transaction being entered.</li>
</ul>

<p>The journal entry form initially opens with fields for two line items, and every journal entry must include lines for at least two accounts. More can be entered, as long as the sum of all debits equals the sum of all credits. For each line:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong><code>Account</code></strong> indicates which account the line will post to. If necessary, subaccount fields appear and must be completed.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>Description</code></strong> accepts information about the individual line item.</li>
<li>Enter debit amounts under the <strong><code>Debit</code></strong> column and credit amounts under <strong><code>Credit</code></strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong><code>Tax</code></strong> codes and <strong><code>Tracking Codes</code></strong> if applicable. Frequently they are not for journal entries. (These fields do not appear unless tax codes and tracking codes have been defined under <kbd>Settings</kbd>.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>Notes</code></strong> accepts detailed information about the transaction.</li>
</ul>

<p>Click <kbd>Add line</kbd> if more lines are needed. In the illustration above, a line has been added for a second <code>Credit</code> amount, because the overall distribution included two elements.</p>

<p>Because debits and credits must balance for all journal entries, Manager calculates the difference between their sums as inputs are made. The difference shows in red to the right of the totals. A red zero indicates a balanced transaction:</p>

<p>Order of lines can be changed by dragging the arrow symbols to their left. Lines can be deleted by click <kbd>X</kbd> to their right.</p>

<p>Click <kbd>Create</kbd> to save the entry.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong><br>By long tradition in accounting, debits in a transaction are entered first, followed by credits. But the order has no financial impact.</p></blockquote>
