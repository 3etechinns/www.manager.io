{% raw %}
<p>Some tax authorities require <strong>withholding tax</strong> (also called <strong>tax withheld at the source</strong>) to increase tax law compliance and secure earlier receipt of tax revenues. In simple terms, customers are required to withhold a portion of the balance due on sales invoices and pay that portion directly to the tax authority. Then, either the customer or the tax authority provides certification of payment of withheld amounts to the business. The business reduces subsequent payments of tax liabilities by amounts already paid on its behalf by its customers.</p>
<p>Withholding tax may be a form of advance payment of income taxes, value added taxes, goods and service taxes, or some combination of these and other types of tax. Manager supports withholding tax accounting through its sales invoice process.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong><br>
As implemented in Manager, withholding tax <strong>does not</strong> refer to deductions on payslips of taxes due from employees. These are referred to as <code>Payslip Deduction Items</code> and are explained in <a href="/guides/9667">another Guide</a>.<br>
<br>Withholding tax cannot be applied on cash receipts, because the full amount of the transaction must be recorded. Further, cash receipts cannot be associated with individual customers’ subaccounts as withholding tax must.</p>

<h3>Activating withholding tax accounts</h3>
<p>Withholding tax functionality does not require activation of any new tabs. Nor do you need to create any new accounts. All necessary accounts are added automatically to your chart of accounts the first time you check the <code>Deduct withholding tax</code> box on a sales invoice:</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.manager.io/uploads/manager1/original/2X/c/c708739d26a333e7e1f9d9da8b1e98ab0bb766dd.png" alt="55 PM" width="184" height="29"></p>
<p>Both accounts created are in the <em>Assets</em> group, because the money they represent technically belongs to the business until it is eventually used to pay taxes owed. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><em>Withholding tax</em></strong> - This account records amounts your customers have paid to the tax authority that are available to offset your tax bill.</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Withholding tax receivable</em></strong> - This account records amounts your customers owe to the tax authority on your behalf but have not yet paid. If withholding tax had not been deducted from sales invoice balances, amounts in this account would be included in <em>Accounts receivable</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Applying withholding tax</h3>
<p>When the <code>Deduct withholding tax</code> box is checked on a sales invoice, two options appear in a dropdown box, <em>Rate</em> and <em>Amount</em>:</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.manager.io/uploads/manager1/original/2X/c/c3c00e8702a9849aac3a092fcce6c5cc61175e2e.png" alt="11 PM" width="236" height="163"> <strong>OR</strong> <img src="https://forum.manager.io/uploads/manager1/original/2X/e/e83fb06f55493645b34288fb5d00e37e5e0a3a58.png" alt="20 PM" width="220" height="161"></p>
<p>Because withholding tax is independent of any other tax code that may be applied, percentage amounts are calculated on the total due, including other taxes. (Remember, withholding tax is not an additional tax, only a way for the tax authority to collect prospective taxes earlier.)</p>
<table style="background-color: #F2F9FF; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px"><tr><td style="font-size: 48px; opacity: 0.25; padding: 20px; padding-top: 15px; padding-right: 0px; vertical-align: top"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></td><td style="padding: 20px">
<p><strong>Note</strong><br>
If various line items on the sales invoice are subject to different withholding rates, calculate the total amount to be withheld manually and enter as an <em>Amount</em>. You may wish to explain the calculation in the <code>Notes</code> field of the sales invoice.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
Sample Consulting invoices Brilliant Industries for advertising design services worth 1,000. (For clarity, all other transactions have been removed.) In this case, no tax is due directly on the design services, but 10% must be withheld by the customer against expected income tax. So the <code>Deduct withholding tax</code> box on the sales invoice is checked, and a <em>Rate</em> of 10% is entered. The resulting sales invoice shows the customer how much to withhold from payment:<br>

<br>900 is posted to <em>Accounts receivable</em> and 100 to <em>Withholding tax receivable</em>:<br>

<br>In the <kbd>Customers</kbd> tab, a new column appears showing <code>Withholding tax receivable</code>:<br>

<h3>Recording customer remittance</h3>
<p>When the customer remits the withheld tax, either the customer or the tax authority will send you some form “proof” of the remittance (a certificate, account statement, voucher, etc.). This “proof” can be recorded in Manager by clicking on the <code>Withholding tax receivable</code> figure in the <kbd>Customers</kbd> tab, then on <kbd>New Receipt</kbd>:</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.manager.io/uploads/manager1/original/2X/2/25da0c8d48d2713396d69aff289a89fd6002360c.png" alt="g5p4GiW" width="296" height="70"></p>
<p>Enter <strong><code>Date</code></strong> and <strong><code>Amount</code></strong> of the customer’s remittance. A <strong><code>Description</code></strong> is optional:</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.manager.io/uploads/manager1/original/2X/a/a6b8e82a21d3730b35e5165a433b626a4b2708e2.png" alt="35 PM" width="456" height="285"></p>
<p>Click <kbd>Create</kbd> to record the transaction. The transaction amount will move from <em>Withholding tax receivable</em> to <em>Withholding tax</em> .</p>
<table style="background-color: #F6FFF2; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px"><tr><td style="font-size: 48px; opacity: 0.25; padding: 20px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; vertical-align: top"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i></td><td style="padding: 20px">
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
Sample Consulting receives proof of remittance by Brilliant Industries. It enters a transaction for 100. The balance sheet shows the movement between the two accounts:<br>

<h3>Using <em>Withholding tax</em> to pay tax bill</h3>
<p>When a tax filing is made, the balance of <em>Withholding tax</em> is available to offset your tax due. Indicate the amount being applied on the appropriate forms of the tax authority and submit with your filing. <strong>This step in the process does not occur in Manager, only in your tax filing.</strong></p>
<p>To record your application of available withholding tax credits in Manager, use a journal entry. Credit <em>Withholding tax</em> and debit either:</p>
<ul>
<li>An appropriate expense account, such as <em>Taxes paid</em>, if the tax is an obligation of the business, or</li>
<li>An equity account, such as <em>Owner’s equity</em> or <em>Capital accounts</em>, depending on your form of organiation, if the tax is an obligation of the owner or partners.</li>
</ul>
<table style="background-color: #F6FFF2; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px"><tr><td style="font-size: 48px; opacity: 0.25; padding: 20px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; vertical-align: top"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i></td><td style="padding: 20px">
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
When it submits its tax filing, Sample Consulting applies the 100 from <em>Withholding tax</em> to its total bill. Sample Consulting is a sole proprietorship, so its income is taxed on the owner’s tax return. Therefore, it makes a journal entry debiting <em>Owner’s equity</em> and crediting <em>Withholding tax</em>. That account is zeroed out on the Balance Sheet.<br>
