<p>Manager can directly <strong>invoice billable expenses</strong>. When you first record a billable expense, its status will be set to <em>Uninvoiced</em>:</p>

<p>To invoice billable expenses to a customer, go to the <kbd>Customers</kbd> tab:</p>

<p>Under the <code>Uninvoiced</code> column, click the amount for the customer you are invoicing:</p>

<p>Select the items you want to bill to the customer, then click <kbd>New Sales Invoice</kbd>:</p>

<table style="background-color: #F2F9FF; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px"><tr><td style="font-size: 48px; opacity: 0.25; padding: 20px; padding-top: 15px; padding-right: 0px; vertical-align: top"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></td><td style="padding: 20px"><p><strong>Note</strong><br>If you have also entered billable time for the customer, these entries will appear in the same list and can be selected for invoicing along with billable expenses.</p></td></tr></table>

<p>A sales invoice will be created instantly:</p>

<p>If you wish to modify the invoice, such as to add other line items, apply a discount, or mark up the expenses for additional profit, click <kbd>Edit</kbd>, make changes, then click <kbd>Update</kbd>.</p>

<p>If you mark up billable expense amounts, the difference between the original expense amount and the marked-up amount will be posted to the special <em>Billable expenses - markup</em> income account. If you allow a discount on a billable expense to your customer, you will incur a loss. This loss will be posted to the <em>Billable expenses - unrecoverable</em> expense account. This makes it's easy for you to track how well you recoup the billable expenses you incur on behalf of your customers.</p>

<p>When you go back to the <kbd>Billable Expenses</kbd> tab, you will see the status of your billable expenses has changed to <em>Invoiced</em>:</p>

Generate a sales invoice from the <kbd>Customers</kbd> tab first, then add any other necessary line items.</p></td></tr></table>
