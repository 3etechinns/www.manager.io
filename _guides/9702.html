title: Dispose of intangible assets

<p>When an intangible asset can no longer enhance future cash flow, it must be <strong>disposed of</strong> in your accounting records. Several circumstances may exist. The intangible asset may have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Already been fully amortized over its useful life</li>
<li>Passed the end of its useful life for your business, but have residual resale value</li>
<li>Been only partially amortized, with useful life and resale value remaining</li>
<li>Been partially amortized, but with no value remaining (became useless early)</li>
</ul>

<p>Other circumstances could also apply, especially if special tax provisions covered purchase of the intangible asset. Regardless of the exact situation, the purchase cost of the intangible asset must be removed from the <em>Intangible assets</em> account and its accumulated amortization must be removed from <em>Intangible assets, accumulated amortization</em>. Otherwise, the balances of these two accounts would grow endlessly as the business purchases assets over the years, even if those assets are no longer owned. Finally, whether the intangible asset is sold or has merely lost its value, the difference between its book value and any amount recovered through disposal must be recorded, either as income or expense.</p>

<p>To dispose of an intangible asset, go to the <kbd>Intangible Assets</kbd> tab, click the <kbd>Edit</kbd> button for the asset disposed, check <kbd>Disposed intangible asset</kbd>, then enter the date of disposal.</p>

<table style="background-color: #F6FFF2; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px"><tr><td style="font-size: 48px; opacity: 0.25; padding: 20px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; vertical-align: top"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i></td><td style="padding: 20px"><p><strong>Example</strong><br>ACME Industries' electric controller patent becomes useless because the company discontinues products in which it is used, even though only two months of its anticipated life have passed. The disposal is recorded as below:<br><br><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/8/8150a47c48ff05a69fe33d03564c73d9272524f0.png" width="452" height="408"> <br></p></td></tr></table>

<p>This transfers any book value of the asset to the <em>Intangible assets - loss on disposal</em> expense account and reduces the book value on the balance sheet to zero. <em>Intangible assets - loss on disposal</em> is a control account activated automatically when the <kbd>Intangible Assets</kbd> tab is enabled.</p>

<table style="background-color: #F6FFF2; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px"><tr><td style="font-size: 48px; opacity: 0.25; padding: 20px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; vertical-align: top"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i></td><td style="padding: 20px"><p><strong>Example</strong><br>After ACME Industries' disposal action, its Balance Sheet shows no balance for either <em>Intangible assets</em> or <em>Intangible assets, accumuated amortization</em>. The Profit and Loss Statement shows two months' worth of amortization expense and the large remaining book value:<br><br><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/4/4b32b58d5b7f7814d989790ba5dd6da3c5ec4f22.png" width="309" height="59"><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/1/12b935ca5900aaa8fdada4a5a19cedcdc7b15ca5.png" width="303" height="59"><br><br>Unless ACME Industries can find a buyer for the patent, this situation will look like a serious business mistake.</p></td></tr></table>

<p>Like intangible asset purchases and amortization, disposals are reported on the Intangible Asset Summary in the <kbd>Reports</kbd> tab:</p>

<table style="background-color: #F2F9FF; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px"><tr><td style="font-size: 48px; opacity: 0.25; padding: 20px; padding-top: 15px; padding-right: 0px; vertical-align: top"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></td><td style="padding: 20px"><p><strong>Note</strong><br>Two methods can be used when a disposed intangible asset is sold. The first is to post a <kbd>Receive money</kbd> transaction to <em>Intangible assets</em> and the specific asset's subaccount prior to recording disposal. This reduces the purchase cost balance, decreasing any loss on disposal. The second is to post the transaction to <em>Intangible assets - loss on disposal</em> after the fact. The net effects are the same.</p></td></tr></table>
