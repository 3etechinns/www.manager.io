<p><strong>Recurring sales invoices</strong> are useful if your business routinely issues similar sales invoices to customers. Once you have set them up, Manager will notify you they ready to be created when they come due at the prescribed intervals.</p>
<h3>Set up a recurring sales invoice</h3>
<p>To create new recurring sales invoice, go to the <kbd>Settings</kbd> tab and click <kbd>Recurring Sales Invoices</kbd>:</p>

<p><strong>Caution</strong><br>
Recurring sales invoices in Manager are templates from which actual sales invoices will be generated later. Setting up a recurring sales invoice does not affect your customer balances, customer statements, inventory, or income. In fact, while Manager will notify you recurring sales invoices are pending, it will not automatically generate them for you. This avoids problems if you need to edit an invoice before issuing it or you forget to enter a service modification by the customer.</p>

<h3>Generate sales invoices</h3>
<p>When one or more recurring sales invoices are due (or past due) to be issued, any time you go to the <kbd>Sales Invoices</kbd> tab you will see a yellow notice that at least one sales invoice is pending:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/7/7976c05e43f35eb7c2d72341f458374da58d4fd9.png" alt="" width="384" height="52"></p>
<p>Click <kbd>Details</kbd> to review invoices to be generated, then press <kbd>Create</kbd>:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/6/61c182fe99bae79a9d800bb2a6a4864bc477920c.png" alt="" width="299" height="195"></p>
<p>All pending sales invoices will be immediately created under the <kbd>Sales Invoices</kbd> tab. You can further <kbd>Edit</kbd> or <kbd>View</kbd> them without affecting future recurring sales invoices:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/3/34bf3ac4b6e60972e761e22dfd7f8252c7170592.png" alt="" width="418" height="121"></p>
<h3>Cancel a recurring sales invoice</h3>
<p>When circumstances change, such as when a customer cancels a subscription, you may want to cancel future recurring sales invoices. Click <kbd>Edit</kbd> for the recurring sales invoice in <kbd>Settings</kbd>, then <kbd>Delete</kbd>:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/4/48c6144da87500b0a2141eec7da5e9aba1b78d65.png" alt="" width="189" height="89"> <strong><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right" style="margin-right: 10px; color: #999; font-size: 18px; padding-top: 5px"></i></strong> <img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/1/1109f7104f9983dcdd1fa9816ba94f56348bad86.png" width="79" height="46"></p>
<p>The recurring sales invoice will be removed from the list and no new sales invoices will be created from it. Cancelled recurring sales invoices cannot be restored. They must be recreated from scratch.</p>
<h3>Skip a sales invoice</h3>
<p>If one or more recurring sales invoices must be skipped, but routine invoicing will resume in the future, click <kbd>Edit</kbd> for the recurring sales invoice in <kbd>Settings</kbd>. Set a new <code>Next issue date</code>, then click <kbd>Update</kbd> to save the change.</p>
<table style="background-color: #F6FFF2; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px"><tr><td style="font-size: 48px; opacity: 0.25; padding: 20px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; vertical-align: top"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i></td><td style="padding: 20px">
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
Your customerâ€™s next recurring sales invoice for monthly service should be generated on 24 September 2015:<br>
<br><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/d/d98b43799f095f68c48e6f63e3bd930f2f3c8963.png" alt="" width="280" height="84"><br>
<br>Your customer pauses the service subscription for one month; therefore, no invoice should be issued on 24th September. The next invoice should be issued on 24th October, so you edit the recurring sales invoice in <kbd>Settings</kbd>:<br>
<br><img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/b/b5a6e1882a66821a4ec35b8fa73acd2f10958787.png" alt="" width="136" height="76"> <strong><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right" style="margin-right: 10px; color: #999; font-size: 18px; padding-top: 5px"></i></strong> <img src="https://cdn-business2.discourse.org/uploads/manager1/original/2X/9/9323536fbd8f420f21e96dd9ae9bb5c6483e9ab7.png" width="84" height="46"><br>
<br>You now see the next sales invoice is due 24th October:<br>
