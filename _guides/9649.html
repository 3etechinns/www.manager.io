<p>Standard <kbd>Billable Time</kbd> entries can be made more useful by adding custom fields. In the <kbd>Settings</kbd> tab, select <kbd>Custom Fields</kbd>. Locate the <kbd>Billable Time</kbd> group and click <kbd>New Custom Field</kbd>:</p>

<p>Define your custom field. This first example adds a single, free-text line for a staff member's name. It is positioned to be first among custom fields. A check mark indicates the field will show as a column in the <kbd>Billable Time</kbd> listing:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong><br>While a check box is available to show the custom field on printed documents, in the case of billable time, this has no effect. This is because a single sales invoice might include line items resulting from billable time of several people. Since custom fields, by default, show at the end of a form, such entries would be meaningless.</p></blockquote>

<p>Additional fields can be added in the same way as the first. The second example adds a service type from a dropdown list, assigned to the second position. Such lists help standardize time entries. More options are available, including paragraph text and images:</p>

<p>The resulting <kbd>Custom Fields</kbd> list shows the result:</p>

<p>Now the <kbd>Billable Time</kbd> listing provides more useful information that can be used for searching and sorting: </p>
