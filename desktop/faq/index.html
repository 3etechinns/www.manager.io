  <div class="col-md">
    <h5 class="font-weight-bold pt-4">Is this 100% free accounting software?</h5>
    <p class="lead mb-4">Yes. You can use the software as long as you like, use all the features and enter as much data as required.</p>
  
    <h5 class="font-weight-bold pt-4">If you give away your software for free, how do you make money?</h5>
    <p class="lead mb-4">Desktop edition is single-user software. Businesses requiring multi-user capabilitities or remote access will typically use cloud edition or server edition which are paid products.</p>
    
    <h5 class="font-weight-bold pt-4">What is the difference between desktop and cloud edition?</h5>
    <p class="lead mb-4">Desktop edition doesn't support multi-user access. If you need multiple users to access your accounting file at the same time, you need cloud edition (or server edition).</p>

  <div class="col-md">
    <h5 class="font-weight-bold pt-4">If I'm working on Mac, can I send my file to an accountant who is on Windows?</h5>
    <p class="lead mb-4">Yes. Manager data is cross-compatible across all operating systems.</p>

    <h5 class="font-weight-bold pt-4">If I want to upgrade to cloud edition in future, can I import my data?</h5>
    <p class="lead mb-4">Yes. Manager data is cross-compatible across all editions.</p>
    
    <h5 class="font-weight-bold pt-4">What happens to my data when I upgrade?</h5>
    <p class="lead mb-4">When you upgrade to the latest version, your data will be automatically rolled-over. Still, we strongly recommend you make regular backups of your data whether you are upgrading or not.</p>
